# Chapman 1917 Historical Databases

This repository contains files, scripts, and data products for the historical databases of Chapman 1917.

There are two historical databases.

	1. **Specimen database** - combined AMNH and CUMV. AMNH - transcribed and digitized from the original handwritten AMNH specimen ledgers by AMNH volunteers. CUMV - Vertnet.

	2. **Chapman 1917** - database derived from the specimen counts per locality that appear below each species' account in the Chapman 1917 monograph.

If you're short on time, the main take home is that while there is generally good correspondance between the two databases, there are some key differences that means that both databases should probably be analyzed separately and combined going forward. And, a physical inventory of the specimens will be necessary.

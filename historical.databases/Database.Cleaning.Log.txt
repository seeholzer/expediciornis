Questions for Tom

What is the significance of the CatalogNumberSuffix field? What do bis, ter, and tris mean?

What is the significance of the various ways that sex is coded?


2020.05.05
- Standardized sex column
- Standardized Collectors
- Split dates into multiple columns

2020.05.06
- merged CollectorNumber.Initials with CollectorNumber.Numeric into single column CollectorNumber. Then removed CollectorNumber.Initials and CollectorNumber.Numeric 


2020.05.19
- Finished the first pass at adding in standardized locality names for the Chapman expeditions
- deleted some empty or nearly empty columns, move data to remarks

2020.05.21
- started the first draft of the taxonomy key

- began by adding notes to document how I synonymized each original taxon name with the Clements taxonomy, but that got old and I just went for it.
	Basic approach as follows - 
	- if the genus was not currently in use in the Clements taxonomy, I found it's synonym through a number of methods
	- I first began in Chapman 1917 which provides the taxonomic synonyms of many of the scientific name as they are listed in the AMNH ledger/database.  
	- Next I would search online to see if there was documentation of generic epithet changes in places like HBW, Avibase, old manuscripts
	- Once the Clements synonym of the genus was satisfactorily known I would then search for variations on the species and subspecies epithets in the Clements taxonomy. Many taxa recognized as species in Chapman 1917 are subsumed as subspecies in Clements. Therefore, the historical-contemporary taxonomic link was made by searching for Chapman's species epithet in the subspecies names of the genus in question.  
	- in some cases, both the species and subspecies epithet are no longer in use (Conurus aeruginosus = Eupsitulla pertinax), in such cases, additional clues either about range, phenotype, or subspecies outside of Colombia were usually present in the Chapman 1917 species accounts that allowed the Clements synonym to be determined
	- in some cases, a unknown taxon's distribution within the Chapman 1917 localities was also used as clue to the correct Clements synonmym. For instance, a taxon collected only from localities in the Choco lowlands, greatly narrowed the possibilities down to only those Clements taxa occurring in that region. Similarly, the specific identity of many specimens only identified at the generic level could be inferred by comparing the numbers of specimens for each of their localities in the database with the same numbers in Chapman 1917.
	- many taxa were listed in the AMNH database as monotypic genera currently (i.e. Nomonynx, Abburia) or formerly in use (e.g. Gnathosittaca, Rhopoterpe). Unless otherwise known to have been split into multiple taxa, these taxa were simply assigned their Clements genus-species name
	- In some cases, the taxon in question was only listed as it's genus despite being from a polytypic genus (e.g. Crax). For such cases, the correct species was inferred based on distribution if only one representative of the genus is known to occur at it's corresponding locality
	- Mispellings in the original ledgers abound and while the transcription of the ledgers to a digital format show incredibly high fidelity, errors were likewise unavoidable given the 12,000+ specimens that were cataloged by hand in the 1910s and then digitized in the 2000s. We have included the original digitized taxonomies, a cleaned version of taxonomy employed by Chapman 1917, and the corresponding Clements taxonomy. 
	
	
	
To do
Need to fix El Roble, 3-4 four localities with the same name.   
Barbacoas dates are all fucked up
incorporate Smithsonian and Cornell data


2020.06.10
converted the species accounts to raw text to begin tabulating an inventory of the number of specimens REPORTED for each locality in Chapman 1917. This can be compared to the actual numbers in the databse

used https://www.pdf2go.com/pdf-to-text OCR engine
very good fidelity except when letters squished together (ae is the most common problem combination) or smudges over letters


2020.06.12
Chapman 1917 reported specimen counts - cleaned and standardized the raw locality names preserving elevations and other more specific descriptors


2020.06.26
corrected OCR conversion mistakes of Chapman scientific names
generally involved finding where -ae- or -oe- was mis-interpreted but also removed some hanging names of the scientists that described the taxon

Started taxonomic key to convert from Chapman 1917 to Clements 2020 
- did not attempt to line up Chapman subspecies with Clements subspecies, while many of the subspecies should be straightforward to line up, others would require significant investigation their taxonomic history, at least for a first pass,  


2020.06.28
Finished Chapman-Clements taxonomy key
cleaned up some formatting issues in the raw text file for the specimen counts
Finished key converting raw localities to specific localities to the generalized locality name (Locality)


2020.10.26
While working on constructing the sampling lists for the upcoming expeditions I decided to compare the specimen counts for each locality between the AMNH database and Chapman 1917. Here are my observations



2020.10.29
- spent past two days building code to compare the Chapman 1917 and AMNH specimen databases
- began organizing data and code and uploading to github
- realized that some of the discrepancies between the two databases could be explained by Cornell specimens. 
- downloaded cornell records from vertnet and have started cleaning these and putting in usable format

2020.10.30
- standardized locality names
- downloaded, cleaned, and incorporated CUMV data
- created expediciornis github repository

2020.11.02
- finished the readme's for the expediciornis github
- sent Slack message to group about the specimen databases
- started looking into specimens at the NMNH then went down a rabbit hole looking at the record of exchanges
	These appear in the DeaccessionNotes and lists 3069 that were sent to other institutions as exchanges or gifts. 1966 (2/3) of these exchanged specimens were from the Chapman Expeditions. Will have to examine the DeaccessionNotes carefully when selecting species to trying to account for missing specimens during physical inventory of AMNH databases.




Methods
- in paper be sure to emphasize that additional details of sex, age, and precise locations collected for many of the specimens can be found.
- for instance, many marsh birds from the Cali were taken in marshes outside of the city specificied in text
- for other specimens, the locality may be modified with a 'below' or 'above'
 


Suggestions - 


1. Taxonomy - To avoid having to make taxonomic adjustments when working between various databases I think all our taxonomies should follow the most up-to-date eBird/Clements checklist. SACC is updated continually based on accepted proposals whereas eBird/Clements once or twice a year so there eBird/Clements tends to lag a bit. However, because the project's observational data will be uploaded through eBird, it makes sense to use the eBird/Clements taxonomy for everything. This will help to simplify the coding during downstream analysis by Camila, myself, and others.



Saucerottia cyanifrons = Amazilia cyanifrons
Sporathraupis cyanocephala = Thraupis cyanocephala
Pipreola riefferi = Pipreola riefferii
Myiopobus flavicans = Myiophobus flavicans
cInnycerthia olivascens = Cinnycerthia olivascens
Cardelina canadensis = Cardellina canadensis
Campyloramphus pusillus = Campylorhamphus pusillus

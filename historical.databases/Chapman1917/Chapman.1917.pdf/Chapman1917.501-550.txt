Sclater records (Cat. B. M. XV, p. 101) both ruficaudatus and subfulous
from Gualaquiza, essentially the locality in which our Zaruma specimens
were taken. I do not, therefore, feel that I am in a position to separate
the Colombian bird without having seen authentic specimens of both rufi-
caudatus and subfulvus.

Inhabits the Subtropical Zone of all three ranges. Specimens from the
mountains about the Cauca Valley average deeper in color below; and
thus more nearly resemble P. m. anzius (Bangs) of Santa Marta than do
those of the Bogoté region. The Santa Marta form, however, is less rufous
above and has the throat fulvous. The Peruvian form, P. m. montanus,
is decidedly more rufous above than striaticollis and has the crown rufous
but little darker than the back, instead of olivaceous, distinctly unlike the
back.

Inhabits the Subtropical Zone of the Western Andes. Hellmayr’s
(L. ¢.) statement that Rhopoctites alogus Bangs is identical with this species,
is confirmed by the examination of Bangs’ type. Comparison with the type
of Thripadectes virgaticeps Lawr-., further indicates that selatert is a sub-
species of that form. The differences between the two consist only of size

and intensity of coloration, virgaticeps being larger and with the back and
underparts more suffused with rufous. In pattern of coloration, that is,
width of shaft-streaks, markings of throat, etc., the two forms are exactly
alike. ;

Lawrence’s type is a trade skin labelled “Quito” and hence may have
come from the Subtropical Zone of either the eastern or western slope of
the Ecnadorian Andes. A specimen collected by Richardson at Ricaurte
(5000 ft.) in extreme southwestern Colombia suggests that the latter slope
may be the true type-locality. It is nearer to virgaticeps than to sclateri
in size, agrees with the latter in the color of the upperparts, but below is
less richly colored than either of the other two. Nevertheless, I am in-
clined to the belief that it is an actual intermediate between them. I
append measurements of all the specimens in our collection, including two
of Thripadectes rufobrunneus (Lawr.) which appears to be a northern repre-
sentative of the group.

Three specimens from the Subtropical Zone above the Magdalena
Valley and one from Buena Vista appear to be referable to this form to
which Hellmayr (P. Z. S., 1911, p. 1151) refers Bogoté specimens. The
intermediate characters shown by one of the LaéCandela examples indicate
the probability of complete intergradation with true subalaris. From that
form mentalis may be known by its blacker head, darker, more olivaceous
back, the generally broader shaft-streaks of the upperparts which extend
well down the back, while the streaks on the underparts reach posteriorly
to the ventral region.

Seven specimens from Buena Vista, above Villavicencio, agree closely
with seven from Cristobal Colon on the Paria Peninsula, and are doubtless,
therefore, typical of this species for which, following Hellmayr (Nov. Zool.,
XIII, 1906, p. 28), I accept Sclater and Salvin as the describers and Caracas
as the typelocality. Four Trinidad specimens are smaller, with shorter
bills, and average brighter above.

Found, with one exception, in the Subtropical Zone of the Western
and Eastern, and doubtless also, the Central Andes. Specimens collected
by Miller and Beyle on the Western Andes are not separable from Buena
Vista specimens and in connection with three recently acquired birds
from Tacarcuna indicate that although the eastern birds average lighter in
color than the western ones, there is but one valid form of this species in
Colombia.

For this I accept the name applied by Hartert to the Ecuador race. Of
this I have but one specimen. It has the rump duller than the remaining
birds in the series, but this, Hartert’s description leads me to believe, is not
a constant character. :

As a whole these birds chiefly differ from true mexicanus in being darker

less rufous. : :

Specimens of S. m. puilus are not now available for comparison but in
view of the individual variation to which this species is subject, it is evident
that they are very close to S. m. obseurior.

A specimen from Villavicencio cannot be satisfactorily referred to any
of the recognized forms of this species. It has the throat ochraceous-buff,
with barely perceptible margins, and is thus unlike true cuneatus in which
the throat is but faintly tinged with buff and distinctly margined. The
underparts have a more olivaceous cast than in the other forms. Identi-
fication of this specimen would not alone require additional examples from
Villavicencio, but a revision of the entire group, which appears, from a
casual examination of the specimens in our collection, to contain several
undescribed forms. ,

Dendrocincla lafresnayet inhabits the Tropical Zone of Colombia west
of the Eastern Andes. Specimens from the Cauca Valley (Rio Frio) agree
with one from Honda and with seven from Santa Marta, but four speci-
mens from the Pacific coast (Névita to Barbacoas) are perceptibly darker
both above and below. Nine specimens from western Ecuador (Manavi)
agree with Santa Marta specimens in color, but have the bill blacker; a
difference due, in part, but not wholly to the fact that they were collected
more recently.

Possibly the variations exhibited by these twenty-two specimens may
be in a measure racial, but I see nothing to be gained by applying names to
differences so minute that their subsequent application becomes largely
a matter of opinion. I have, for example, a specimen of this species from
Panama which can be matched by several specimens in the series under

consideration, which Lawrence, Sclater, Ridgway, Oberholser, and Chap-
man have each determined differently! Allen, Ridgway, Hellmayr and
Oberholser agree in referring Santa Marta specimens to this form, and in
default of a more definite place it may be well to accept Valparaiso, Santa
Marta, as the type-locality.

Inhabits the Tropical Zone of the Pacific slope and eastward into An-
tioquia. Our specimens have been compared with a series from western
Ecuador. The occurrence of typical specimens of X. triangularis at Cocal
on the western slope of the Western Andes at an altitude of 4000 feet (the
lower border of the Subtropical Zone) in connection with the constancy
in color maintained by that species throughout its wide range, induces me
to believe that it does not intergrade with equatorialis. The differences
between the two species, described by Hellmayr (J. c.) are shown by our
large series of both forms.

" Dendrornis triangularis Sc. & Saxv., P. Z. 8., 1879, p. 523 (Sta. Elena).

Common in the Subtropical Zone of all three ranges. I detect’ practi-
cally no racial variation in our series of forty-eight specimens, though those
from the Western and Central Andes may average slightly more rufescent
above. The white area along the cutting-edge of the central part of the
maxilla to which Hellmayr (P. Z. S., 1911, p. 1154) calls attention is present
in all but five of our specimens. Two of these are from Cocal, one from
Anolaima, near Bogoté, one from Fusugasugé, and one from Buena Vista.
I do not regard the absence of this character in the Cocal birds as indicating

intergradation of étriangularis with a@quatorialis, which doubtless occurs at’ -

a few hundred feet below Cocal. In other respects these two Cocal birds
are typical triangularis having the throat feathers margined or ringed in
squamate pattern, the crown with shaft-streaks. Furthermore, in three
other specimens from Cocal the whitish mark on the maxilla is conspicuous,
while its absence in specimens from the Bogoté region shows that it is not
a constant character.

specimens from Cayenne, British Guiana, Santarem, and Bahia. Possibly
the difference may be due to the freshness of the skins, which, in other re-

A single specimen from Ricaurte agrees with three others from Gualea,
Ecuador. All differ from a specimen from Yungas, Bolivia, in’ being
slightly darker, more rufous above and in having the ground color below
slightly brighter, the stripes narrower and more fulvous. From P. laery-
miger the Ricaurte and Ecuador specimens differ in being darker, more
rufescent above and below with the stripes of the underparts narrow, more
linear, less guttate in form and more fulvous in color. In pattern the Ri-
caurte and Gualea specimens more nearly resemble P. 1. sancte-marte
but the latter has the streaks below much broader and white, and is conse-
quently more like the Bolivia specimen mentioned above.

tends southward into western Ecuador, northward to Panama and east-
ward at least to Venezuela. After examining Lafresnaye’s type in the
Paris Museum, Sclater (Cat. Bds. B. M. XV, p. 152) refers ‘Bogota’ and
Antioquia specimens to the species it represents and there can therefore
be little doubt that the bird here under consideration is the Picolaptes al-
bolineatus of Sclater’s monograph. I can, however, detect no difference
between Colombia and two Panama R. R. Line specimens which have been
compared with the type of Picolaptes lineaticeps Lafr. and which differ from
it only in having the bill slightly smaller and darker.

If, therefore, the Colombia birds are rightly referred to albolineatus it
follows that Kineaticeps is synonymous with that species.

A female from Villavicencio resembles one from Cumanacoa, Venezuela,
but is somewhat-darker and has the black margins of the crown and throat
more pronounced. It differs from the specimen from La Morelia, referred
provisionally to procurvotdes, in the larger white throat area, more streaked
breast and dorsal shaft-streaks and darker crown. A male from. Alto

Xiphorhynchus thoracicus Scu., P. Z. S., 1860, p. 277 (Babahoyo, w. Ecuador).

A specimen from Buenavista, Narifio, agrees with specimens from west-
ern Ecuador. Two types of coloration are shown by our series of eleven
1917.) Chapman, Distribution of Bird-life in Colombia. 425

specimens from Esmeraldas, Chone, Naranjo, and Santa Rosa, Ecuador.
In one (four specimens) the color, particularly below, is more rufescent and
the black markings of the crown and underparts are less pronounced. The
other (seven specimens) is more olivaceous, the median stripes of crown
and underparts are somewhat paler and their borders blacker. Both types
are present at Esmeraldas and both contain representatives of both sexes.
The Buenavista specimen belongs to the darker type as does also the speci-
men from Santa Rosa. The variation appears therefore to be individual.

While doubtless a representative of the trochilirostris type this form
appears to me to be now specifically distinct. The form of trochilirostris
(C. t. procurvoides or a near ally) nearest to it geographically resembles it
least, while the occurrence of pusillus at Barbacoas in the same faunal zone
as Buenavista, whence comes our Colombian specimen of thoracicus, indi-
cates its distinctness from that species.

?Campylorhamphus chapmani Ripaw., Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., XXII, 1909, p. 74
(“unknown locality’).

This well-marked species is typically represented by a specimen from
Fusugasugé and by a ‘Bogota’ skin. A female from Miraflores in the Cen-
tral Andes agrees with these skins, but a male which I shot from the same
tree is less rufescent and more olivaceous both above and below. A male
from Saléncio, in the western Andes west of Cartago, is, in general coloration,
between the male and female from Miraflores. A male from San Antonio
is somewhat more richly colored than the Miraflores male and has the bill
stouter. A male from.Cocal on the whole resembles the San Antonio bird
but has the bill even heavier. A male from Barbacoas has the bill as heavy
as that of the Cocal specimen, the plumage is still deeper in tone and the
markings on the crown are darker and are reduced to shaft-streaks. Both
the characters it exhibits, and the zone it inhabits, indicate that this Barba-
coas specimen represents a well-marked race of pusillus.

The material at my command does not permit me to reach a satisfac-
tory conclusion concerning the status of this west Colombian form. The
case is further complicated by the interesting fact that the Salencio speci-
men above mentioned, is essentially a duplicate in color and size of the type
of Campylorhamphus chapmani Ridgw. (Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., XXII,

 

1 See also Hartert, Nov. Zool., IX, 1902, p. 618.
426 Bulletin American Museum of Natural History. [Vol. XXXVI,

1909, p. 74). The type of chapmant differs only in having the crown and
nape somewhat more broadly striped. The latter is without locality but
the ‘make’ of skin resembles that of specimens from Antioquia. If this
really be the region whence it came, its identity with the Salencio speci-
men is explained. It would follow, therefore, that geographically as well
as in characters, chapmani is intermediate between pusillus and the dark
coast form represented by the Barbacoas specimen. Whether it may stand
for that race or whether, as the two birds from Miraflores indicate, it is not
separable from pusillus remains to. be determined.

Campylorhamphus pusillus is omitted from Brabourne and Chubb’s
list doubtless through an oversight. Its brownish bill without the reddish
tinge shown by members of the trochilirostris group, and its cinnamon-buff
throat readily serve to distinguish it.

In’the other, however, the crown is pronouncedly more rufescent than the
back. A similar variation is shown in a small series from El Real, eastern

it is nearly like the back. Both are males. I have seen no authentic speci-

Inhabits the Temperate Zone of all three ranges. A satisfactory study
of our thirty-six specimens is prevented by the fact that only one of them
is from the Bogoté region, the type-locality. . This specimen, taken for us
by a native collector on May 12, 1913, at Palo Hueco, Cundinamarca, near
Bogota, cannot be matched by any of our thirty-four specimens from the
western and central ranges. From more western specimens of the same
season it differs in being more olivaceous above, and should the differenogs
exhibited prove constant, the birds of the Central and Western Andes may
be separated and with them may probably be placed birds from Ecuader,
since a single specimen from Pichincha, while darker, is obviously nearer
to west Colombian specimens than to the Bogota bird.

Comparison of this fresh Bogota skin with three old ‘Bogoté’ birds
shows a surprising difference in color since the old birds are much ruddier
above, the back being snuff-brown, while that of the recently collected skin
is olive buffy-brown.

This species appears to be found chiefly in the upper part of the Sub-
tropical Zone, since we have failed to secure it at sych localities as San
Antonio and Miraflores, where our work has been more or less thorough.
I can detect no racial differences in our series of fifteen specimens from the
three ranges, but comparison of new with old skins from the Bogoté region
shows striking differences in color, the old birds being fuscous, the fresh -
ones slate-black above, and on the breast, while the abdomen in old birds
is russet, in fresh ones, it is deep chestnut.

collected birds from Gualea, Ecuador (which are doubtless typical of grati-
osa) shows that specimens from the Andes west of Popayan are true gratiosa,
those from the Central Andes differ in having the rufous wing-bars narrower,
while two from the vicinity of Bogoté show an appreciable approach toward
Ochtheca gratiosa jesupt (Allen) (of which we have four specimens, includ-
ing the type) in their somewhat yellower less olivaceous underparts, less
rufescent back, less blackish crown, and particularly, in their more nar-
rowly tipped wing-coverts, the last-named character being barely evident
in jesupit. Specimens from the Bogotd region are, therefore, intermediate
and, though nearer. gratiosa, indicate probable intergradation with jesupi.
Old ‘Bogot4’ skins have the yellow areas paler than in fresh ones, and, it
may be added, that an old ‘Quito’ specimen of gratiosa, while paler below,
is much more rufescent above than those secured by us at Gualea.

Abundant and conspicuous in scrubby growths in the Temperate Zone
of all three ranges. Having no Peruvian specimens I am unable to make
comparison with true leucophrys. Specimens from the Western and Cen-
tral Andes average slightly larger, and are perceptibly darker and with
the ochraceous wing-markings richer and wider than others from the Bogota
region. They are, however, wholly unlike the brown-backed Ochtheca
rufomarginata of Lawrence, assuming that the type and one topotype of
this species in the American Museum properly represent the species. Con-
sequently, while I agree with von Berlepsch! that rufomarginata is better
placed in Mecocerculus than in Ochtheca, I cannot believe with Hellmayr ”
that it is subspecifically related.to M. leucophrys.

Old ‘ Bogoté’ skins are much browner above than the fresh onés obtained
by us, and their faded condition, not realized at the time, is responsible for
my description of Mecocerculus nigriceps* from Las Palmales, eastern
Venezuela, the type of which agrees closely with the birds collected by us
at Chipaque.

Rhynchocyclus sulphurescens asemus Banas, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., XXIII,
1910, p. 73 (Pavas, alt. 440 ft., W. Andes, Col.).

Four males, one each from Dabeiba, Cali, Rio Frio and Miraflores,
agree in color with the type and two other specimens of asemus, loaned me
by Mr. Bangs, but are smaller, the wing averaging 66.5, the tail 58.5, as
compared with wing, 70; tail, 59 in asemus.

This form is evidently an offshoot of sulphurescens of northern Colombia,
and specimens from the middle Magdalena Valley in their grayer crown,
are evidently intermediate between it and Santa Marta specimens (R. s.
exortivus Bangs). . Although in its grayer throat and breast it suggests
cinereiceps, it does not, in my opinion, stand as a connectant between that
species and sulphurescens, since representatives of both Rhynchocyclus
sulphurescens flavo-olivaceus Lawr. (Type, Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., No. 42669)
and R. marginatus Lawr. (Type, Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., No. 42672) were

collected by Galbraith on the line’ of the Panama Railroad. Furthermore,
we have a specimen of R. marginatus from Névita, in the same faunal region
as Jimenez (alt. 1600 ft.) whence came two of Bangs’ specimens of asemus.*

The two groups are distinguished chiefly by the yellowish breast and
throat and greenish head of sulphurescens, and grayish breast, throat and
head of cinereiceps. Apparently cinereiceps does not intergrade with mar-
ginatus since five Costa Rican specimens show no approach to our two.speci-
mens of marginatus from Panama.

(2759) Rhynchocyclus sulphurescens assimilis Pelz.

Rhynchocyclus assimilis Peuz., Orn. Bras., 1869, p. 110 (Borba, Brazil, fide

Four specimens from Villavicencio and Buena Vista, in the Tropical
Zone at the eastern base of the Eastern Andes, are brighter green above
and somewhat yellower below than a specimen from Florencia and another
from Mt. Duida, near the headwaters of the Orinoco, but in other respects,
including the well-developed gray crown, which chiefly distinguishes them,
these birds all agree.

Dr. Hellmayr writes me that in his fortheoming paper on the genus
Rhynchocyclus he will show that the type-locality of assimilis is Borba on
the Madeira. Possibly therefore five specimens from the headwaters of
the Rio Roosevelt may be considered as fairly topotypical of that race. All
have the gray crown but they are brighter than the Colombian birds and
lave the wing-quills and particularly coverts more widely margined with
greenish yellow. No doubt the Colombian bird is separable but such sepa-
ration to be satisfactory requires a more.thorough study of the group than
my material permits.

‘dalena is nearer the former while another from Chicoral in the more arid

region above Honda is nearer the latter. Specimens from Malena and

Puerto Valdivia have the crown grayish, but the throat yellowish and might

be referred to either form. On purely faunal grounds I therefore place the

Magdalena Valley bird under exortivus, the Puerto Valdivia one with asemus.

Rhynchocyclus cinereiceps flavotectus Hetim., P. Z. 8., 1911, p. 1126 (Névita;
Noanamé).

Allowing for a very slight difference possibly due to the fading in the
older specimen, specimens from western Colombia agree with the type of
R. marginatus Lawr., from the line of the Panama R. R. While its gray
head and grayish breast indicate that marginatus is apparently a repre-
sentative of cinereiceps, it seems not to intergrade with that species (Ridgw.,
Bull. 50, IV, Pp. 392). As in some other instances, forms of Guianan and
Ecuadorian origin evidently meet at Panama in Rhynchocyclus sulphures-
cens flavo-olivaceus on the one hand and R. m. marginatus on the other.

A specimen from Barbacoas and another from Buenavista, Narifio,
closely resemble the type and cotype of R. marginatus from Panama, from
which they differ only in being slightly darker above and in having the edg-
ing to the wing-coverts more ochraceous in tone. The first-named dif-
ference is doubtless due to the fading of the types, while the second is
seasonal since it is shown by a specimen from Puerto Valdivia which, in
the color of the wing-coverts as well as in other respects, agrees with the
birds from Barbacoas and Buenavista.

A specimen from Esmeraldas and three from Guayaquil agree and differ
from marginatus in having the crown grayer with no admixture of green, the
throat and breast yellower, with grayish only on the chin, the wing-coverts
less widely margined. They evidently are racially different from the Barba-
coas, Buenavista and other Colombian specimens and possibly may repre-
sent flavetectus Hart. (Nov. Zool., IX; p. 608, San Javier, n. w. Ecuador).

color as the back, distinguish viridiceps.

After comparison with the type, I refer two specimens from La Morelia
and three from Florencia, in the upper Caqueté region, together with one
from Mt. Duida, near the head of the Orinoco to this species. It is charac-
terized by small size, (wing, co’, 55 mm.), a gray crown, and chiefly by a
dark, horn-color mandible which, basally, is paler, and is therefore quite
unlike the uniformly colored, brownish mandible of sulphurescens. The
specific distinctness of klagesi and sulphurescens is attested by the fact that
at Florencia and Mt. Duida we have found both klagest and sulphurescens
assimilis.

and thus approach the Central American form 1. c. finitimwm to which,
indeed, some of them might readily be referred. As a rule, however,

Six specimens from extreme southwestern Colombia agree with a series
of eight birds from Rio de Oro and Chone, Manavi, Ecuador, and thus in-
troduce this Ecuadorian form into Colombia.

While obviously a representative of Todirostrum cinereum, its grayer
upperparts, paler underparts, and whitish throat are not approached by
specimens from the Chocé region, a fact which suggests the complete de-
tachment of the more southern form. In size, selateri agrees with the small
Central American race, T. c. finitimum, five males, having an average wing-
measurement of 42 mm., but the comparatively small amount of gray on
the upperparts of this form, make it less like sclateri in color than is true —

grayness of its breast and obsoletely streaked throat, approaches T. s.
griseolum Todd (Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., 1913, 170, El Hacha, n. Venezuela).
The last-named form, as it is represented by four specimens including the
type, loaned me by Mr. Todd, is very near swperciliare, but has a smaller
bill and averages darker above and grayer on the breast and throat.

From true schistaceiceps, of Central America, superciliare differs in hav-
ing less yellow on the flanks and particularly abdomen, the latter being in
some specimens with scarcely a tinge of yellow.

The differences between topotypical specimens of the three races of
this species are so slight that the satisfactory identification of specimens
from other localities is attended with some difficulty, nevertheless all our
remaining nine Colombian specimens were taken as far apart as Los Cis-
neros on the western slope of the Western Andes to Villavicencio at the
eastern base of the Eastern Andes appear to be referable to I. s. superciliare.
A female from the last-named locality is somewhat darker above than typi-

Pseudotriccus pelzelni Tacz. & BERL., P. Z. 8., 1885,"p. 88 (Machay, e. Ecuador).

After comparison with a topotype of P. p. berlepschi Nels. loaned me
by Mr. Nelson, I have no doubt that a specimen taken at Buena Vista is
essentially typical of this species, the type of which came from the same
slope of the Andes at approximately the same altitude. The bird was
flushed from the ground in the dense growth which had sprung up in
the bed of a brook and flew to a perch but a few inches from the ground
on the side of the barranca. This circumstance suggests that the species
is more or less terrestrial, a theory of some interest in connection with its
long tarsi. _ an

The affinities of this genus seem to me to be with Cenofriccus rather
than with Myiobius or its related genera or subgenera (Myiophobus, Pyr-
rhomyias, etc.). In its more rounded wing, more graduated tail, character
of the tail-feathers, and Jong tarsi it is not unlike Cenotriccus. In color-
pattern there is a strong resemblance between the young of Cenotriccus
ruficeps and Pseudotriccus and while the bill in P. pelzelni is broader than
in C. ruficeps the difference is slight and of degree rather than character.

Pseudomytobius annectens Sauvap. & Fust., Boll. Mus. Tor., XV, 1899, p. 12

Four adults from the Subtropical Zone of the Western Andes agree in
generic and specific characters with the description of the type of this species
which it is important to note, was taken in the same life-zone in a neighbor-
ing part of Ecuador.

The color differences between Pseudotriccus pelzelni pelzelnt and P. an-
nectens are so largely bridged by the much browner P. p. berlepschi Nels.
of eastern Panama, it seems not improbable that the latter is a represen-
tative and possibly conspecific form of annectens. It goes without saying,
therefore, that I am unable to discover any generic differences between
Pseudotriccus and Pseudomytobius. Compared with.a topotype of ber-
lepschi, annectens differs only in its larger size and color, the crown being
darker, back more olivaceous, less fulvous.

(2820) Cenotriccus ruficeps ruficeps (La/r.).

Muscicapa (Todirostrum) ruficeps Larn., Rev. Zool. 1843, p. 291 (Colombia).

Occurs from the upper part of the Subtropical to the Temperate Zone
in all three ranges. Specimens from the Central and Western Andes have
the head slightly paler than those from near Bogot4. Old ‘Bogot&’ skins
are not unlike fresh ones. Two immature specimens taken at Cocal, June
16 and 17, 1911, respectively, differ from adults in lacking the rufous head,
the crown being but slightly browner than the back, the chin like the throat.
One of these birds has several rufous feathers in the crown showing its un-
mistakable relations to ruficeps, which we have also taken at Cocal. The
other, differs only in lacking these rufous feathers and bears, therefore, so
strong a resemblance to Cenotriccus simplex Berl. (of which I have one
specimen, the type of my Ochtheca keaysi, identified as C. simplex “or
subsp.” by von Berlepsch !) as to suggest that simplex is based on an im-
mature example of C. r. hapalopteryx, the southern form of ruficeps. Our
specimen of simplex differs from the young of ruficeps much as hapalopteryz
is said to differ from it. That is, the back is browner, the margins of the
wings and tail less brightly rufous. In size, the specimen of simplex is
slightly larger and the mandible is darker than in the young of ruficeps.
The bill is larger than in most specimens of rujiceps but can be matched by
examples in our series. In short, if Cenotriccus simplex is not synonymous
with Cenotriccus ruficeps hapalopteryx, the young of the latter is practically
identical with it!

In southwestern Colombia, at sea-level and upward to 2500 ft., and south-
ward in the humid coast region of Ecuador, L. s. sguamecristatus of the Sub-
tropical Zone, is represented by a small form which agrees in size with the
Costa Rican race. The crest, however, appears .to be less developed than
in the Bogota form. The differences in color between squamecristatus and
minor are so slight that without reasonably comparable specimens, color
characters are not to be depended on. Our Ecuador birds are not taken
at the same season as those from Chiriqui and hence satisfactory compari-
son of their colors cannot be made. However, as the appended table shows,
Ecuador birds resemble Costa Rican ones in size, though in color they do not
differ appreciably. It should be noted that no representative of this species -
has been recorded from the coast region of Colombia north of Barbacoas.

Hapalocercus paulus Autumn, Bull. A. M. N. H., XIII, 1900, p. 150 (Chirua; San

A female from Chicoral in the upper Magdalena Valley appears to me
to be inseparable from H. meloryphus, which, however, is too poorly repre-
sented in our collection to permit of satisfactory identification of the Chico-
ral specimen. The type of meloryphus is too faded to be of value in this
connection, so far as color is concerned, and in addition to it I have but one -
specimen from Matto Grosso and one from the Parana (U.S. N. M., 20993).
The differences between our specimen, which is in worn plumage, and those
from Matto Grosso and the Paran4, which are in fresh plumage, are ap-
parently seasonal. This view finds support in a series of eight specimens,
including the type of Hapalocercus paulus, loaned me by Mr. Bangs, most
of which closely match the more southern birds in color, and if the latter

Habrura pectoralis bogotensis Cuapm., Bull. A. M. N. H., XXXIV, 1915, p. 646
(Subia, Bogoté Savanna, Col.).

Similar to H. p. pectoralis but more richly colored throughout, the buffy areas of
pectoralis largely ochraceous-tawny; the lores, margins to frontal feathers, auricular
region, rump, wing-bars and quill margins ochraceous-tawny, the foreback blackish
brussels-brown; crown black, margined with ochraceous-tawny; underparts largely
ochraceous-tawny, the throat and center of the abdomen yellowish buffy; a band of
ochraceous-tawny crossing the breast; size between that of pectoralis and brevipennia.
Wing, 44.5; tail, 40; tarsus, 17; culmen, 10 mm.

This is the fourth new bird taken in the marshes where I had the good
fortune to shoot the types of Ixobrychus exilis bogotensis and Agelaius ictero-
cephalus bogotensis, and from which Brother Apolinar secured the type of
Cistothorus apolinari. «

Evidently the native collectors who, during the past eighty years, have
been shipping birds’ skins from Bogoté, have collected chiefly on the forested
slopes of the Andes, neglecting the country at the city’s gates.

Geographically, the nearest species of the genus Habrura to the one
here described, is Habrura pectoralis brevipennis Berl. & Hart. (Nov. Zool.,
TX, 1902, p. 40). This is a small form of pectoralis, which it is said to re-
semble in color, of the lower Orinoco and British Guiana and hence of
the Tropical Zone. It follows, therefore, that as with Agelaius icterocepha-
lus bogotensis, we have in the bird here described a form of a Tropical
Zone species apparently isolated on the Temperate Zone Savanna of Bogoté.

This fact, in connection with the bird’s degree of differentiation, sug-
gests its specific distinctness, but although I believe that actual intergra-
dation does not occur I feel that the bird’s relationships are best expressed
by a trmomial. We are indebted for the type and only specimen of this
new form to Brother Apolinar Maria, Director of the Instituto de la Salle,
of Bogota, whom we have to thank for invaluable coéperation in our study
of the birds of that region.

to say whether our specimens are properly referred to the Peruvian form.
Birds from the Bogoté region have the head appreciably greener than those
from the Western Andes, and it is probable that they, at least, are separable
from poliocephala.

specifically distinct. From a Yungas, Bolivia, example, our Colombian
birds differ in being much brighter yellow throughout, the belly being canary
instead of yellowish gray. Two birds from Guacharo, northeast Venezuela,
agree with Colombian specimens, but two Guatemalan specimens are much
smaller. .

Two specimens from Chicoral are evidently typical of this form. They
differ from two Bahia examples of flaveola in having broader wing-bars, a
larger bill, a grayish frontal band and loral stripe and a whitish chin.

Four specimens from Cumanacoa, Bermudez, Venezuela, have the bill
as large as in leucophrys but in color are perhaps near flaveola. They are,
therefore, fairly intermediate between the Bahia and Bogoté forms.

A single specimen from Buena Vista, above Villavicencio in. the east

triccus” zeledoni from Costa Rica and Chiriqui, a fact which suggested
the specific identity of this species and Tyranniscus leweogonys Scl. & Salv.,
based on a Bogoté skin. This suspicion was confirmed on the discovery
that leucogonys was referred to their new genus Acrochordopus by Berlepsch
and Hartert, because, among other characters, it possesses a pycnaspidean
tarsus (fully developed in our specimen). Acrochordopus has some months’
priority over Idiotriccus just as zeledoni has over leucogonys, and if, as stated
by Berlepsch and Hartert, this species is congeneric with Acrochordopus
subviridis (Pelz)., the type of the genus (a species I have not seen), it should
apparently stand as above.

specimen is obviously immature, the other appears to be adult; and al-'
though it agrees with the two birds first mentioned in every detail of pat-
tern and size, differs so conspicuously in its less yellow more grayish color,
that it is difficult to believe they are conspecific. Nevertheless, I pro-
visionally refer it and the El Eden specimen to cinereiceps.

Appears to be rare on the Pacific Coast but occurs throughout most
of the remaining territory explored by us chiefly in the Subtropical Zone,
but ranging upward to 9000 ft. at Sta. Elena. Our series of forty-six speci-
mens confirms the existence of a small race (7. c. minimus, Bull. A. M. N.
H., 1912, p. 153) of this species but indicates that it is not confined to the
Santa Marta region but may occur in the Tropical Zone of the lower Cauca
and Magdalena Valleys. We have not, however, a sufficient number of
specimens to solve this problem in distribution which is rendered compli-
cated by the large amount of sexual variation in size shown by this species.
This makes accurate sexing of specimens of the first importance and in
default of a satisfactorily sexed series from the Caribbean region as well
as from Ecuador, I can make no attempt to define the ranges of the large
and small forms of this species. Specimens from the west. Bogoté region
are somewhat larger than others from Ecuador and appear to have the
frontlet brighter yellow, but four birds from what we may call the east
Bogoté region (Villavicencio) agree with the Ecuadorian examples both in
color and size. There seems, therefore, to be no reason for recognizing a
Bogota form.

(2951) Elenia pudica brachyptera Berl.

Elenia brachyptera Brru., Proc., IV, Int. Orn. Cong., 1907, p. 407 (San Pablo,
w. Col.).

A series of birds from southwestern Colombia occupies the range
assigned to this species, and in color differs from Elenia griseigularis as
brachyptera is said to differ from it. Our males, however, have the wing
ranging from 71 to 74 mm. instead of from 56.5 to 69.2 mm., the measure-
ments given by von Berlepsch; but Hartert (Nov..Zool., V, 1898, p. 487)
records four males from Ecuador as measuring, Wing, 79 mm. Since this
is the only form of Elenia secured by us in the Subtropical Zone of south-
western Colombia, I assume in spite of this apparent discrepancy in size
that our specimens should be referred to brachyptera.

Compared with a specimen from Marcapata, southern Peru, labelled
by von Berlepsch “ Elenia pallatange,” they are decidedly more olivaceous,
less brownish above and have black wings and tail; but the outer margin
of the outer pair of rectrices is usually yellowish or grayish as in pallatange.

We have a specimen recently collected by Richardson at Zamora in
southeastern Ecuador which agrees with the specimens listed below, ex-
cept that the outer web of the outer rectrices is of the same color as the
inner web. .

The distributional facts involved in connection with the close resem-
blance existing between the two forms, strongly suggests the conclusion
that brachyptera is a southern form of pudica. Both occupy the same zone,
pudica in its more northern, and brachyptera its more southern part; thus,
like representative races, one replaces the other and at no point have we
found them together. Aside from the fact that brachyptera has a concealed
white crest which pudica is without, the differences between the two birds
are of a purely racial nature, brachyptera being very slightly darker above
and somewhat yellower below. However, three specimens of pudiea from
the northern Central Andes (Barro Blanco and Rio Toché) have a distinct
indication of white in the crown and to this extent approach brachyptera
with which I believe pudica intergrades.

von Berlepsch’s (J. c.) belief that birds from that region (E. brownt Bangs)
are not separable from pudica Scl. /

The Bogota birds average darker but the difference is slight and wholly
bridged by individual variation. I agree with Ridgway that this bird is not
specifically related to E. frantzi (ef. Bull. U. S. N. M. 50, IV, p. 897), but
as stated below, suspect that it does intergrade with E. brachyptera Berl.

(2965a) Myiopagis viridicata accola Bangs.

Mytopagis placens accola Bancs, Proc. N. E. Zool. Club, ILI, 1992, p. 35 (Boquete,
Pan.).

Inhabits the Tropical Zone of western Colombia from the Pacific coast
to the Cauca Valley. The determination of our specimens of this group
has involved a prolonged study of topotypical material of all the forms con-
cerned. The conclusions reached in regard to the distribution of M. ».
accola and M. v. pallens are at variance with those presented by previous
authors, and also apparently with the laws of distribution, but they are
evidently supported by the specimens examined.

These indicate that accola, described from western Panama, ranges
northward at least through Nicaragua, and although Panama Canal Zone
(Lion Hill?) specimens are referable to pallens of northern Colombia, accola
appears again in western Colombia. ,

The absence of records from Panama, east of Chiriqui, may be due to lack
of specimens, to a hiatus in the range of this form, or to parallelism. If it. oc-
curs in the Canal Zone it must necessarily be restricted to the southern slope
since specimens collected by McLeannan and Galbraith, doubtless at Lion
Hill, are unquestionably referable to pallens. If it is not found in Panama
east of Chiriqui we have not to resort to the theory of parallelism to account
for its reappearance in Colombia, since we have numerous similar cases,
though, it is true, they are chiefly among species of the Subtropical Zone.

However this may. be, the fact remains that ten specimens from Chiri-
458 Bulletin American Museum of Natural History. [Vol. XXXVI,

qui, Costa Rica and Nicaragua are not separable from fourteen specimens
from western Colombia, while three from the Canal Zone are not separable
from an equal number from Bonda, near Santa Marta, Colombia.

The characters by which accola may be distinguished from pallens are
more grayish, less greenish borders to the yellow crown-patch, darker up-
perparts, and greater extension posteriorly of the grayish on the breast.
The significant character, is, in my opinion, the color of the sides of the
crown. In this respect pallens agrees with true viridicata, of which we have
five specimens from Paraguay, while accola’resembles implacens, of which
we have four specimens from western Ecuador. This is in accord with the
distribution of the two groups. That is, the green-headed birds from east
of the Andes might be expected to occur in the Santa Marta region whence,
as in many other species, they have evidently ranged westward to Panama,
while the gray-headed birds are West Andean and range from the Pacific
coast of Ecuador north to Central America.

Specimens from the Cauca and Magdalena Valleys are intermediate.
The former are nearer accola, the latter, pallens. Muyiopagis viridicata im-
placens (Scl.) of western Ecuador is a somewhat smaller bird than accola
with the gray of the head more pronounced and darker. We have taken
it in the same localities (vicinity of Guayaquil and Puna Island) as M. sub-
placens, a larger bird with a decidedly longer tarsus (tarsus 20-22 mm.),
a well-defined superciliary and obscurely streaked throat and breast.

In some Colombian specimens of accola the tarsus might fairly be called
pycnaspidean, the tarsal envelope being incomplete with, in several speci-
mens, an indication of tubercles or papille, on its hinder margin. Others
appear to be fairly exaspidean. If my diagnosis of this character is correct
its variability in a single species strongly impugns its value in classification.

Of two adult specimens from Honda one is wholly typical of pallens,
the other, in its somewhat darker color above shows a slight approach
toward accola. Topotypical specimens of pallens are very near Paraguayan
specimens of viridicata but are slightly paler above and have larger bills.
Both races agree in having the sides of the crown oil-green.

One of our Santa Marta specimens has: distinct tubercles on the back
of the tarsus, in others the tarsal envelope is essentially entire.

from the Caribbean coast both to the east and west of Santa Marta (Puerto
Bello, Venezuela; Carthagena, Colombia). Although we have specimens of
columbianus from Esmeraldas and southward in the coast region of Ecuador,
it does not appear to have been recorded from the Pacific coast of Colombia.
Some specimens from the vicinity of Merida, Venezuela, mark the first
steps of intergradation between columbianus and similis in the slightly

_ rufous edgings to the central wing-quills and buffy tint of the wing-linings,

and a further approach toward the Brazilian form is found in specimens
from Villavicencio and La Morelia. Myiozetetes similis therefore, as pre-
vious authors have already suggested, evidently ranges from: Brazil to
Mexico and the northern form should stand as Mytozetetes similis texensis.

Not common but doubtless occurs throughout the greater part of tropi-

from Villavicencio and a female from the Cunucunuma River (near the head
of the Orinoco) are darker than Panama birds (including the types) above
and deeper yellow below, while the crown is more strongly striped. In
color they agree with a specimen from Barbacoas (¢f. von Berlepsch, Nov.

Specimens from the eastern base of the Andes are clearly not to be re-
ferred to the form which occupies the entire Caribbean coast and westward
to Costa Rica. The central wing-quills are more rufous, the wing-lining
more cinnamon, and in the coloration of these parts they are nearer Bahia
specimens than to true columbianus. These characters are particularly
well shown in a freshly plumaged bird taken at La Morelia, July 11, but the
More worn condition of birds taken at Buena Vista and Villavicencio in
March, has left but little rufous on the external margin of the quills, though
the cinnamon color of the inner margins is sufficiently pronounced to dif-
ferentiate them from columbianus. The freshly plumaged Morelia bird
differs from a comparable specimen from eastern Brazil in having the back
more olive, the throat more yellow and apparently therefore agrees with
the form from eastern Peru to which, in the absence of Peruvian specimens,
I have provisionally referred it.

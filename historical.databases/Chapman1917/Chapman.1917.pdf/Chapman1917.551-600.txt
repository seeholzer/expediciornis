Two specimens of Pitangus sulphuratus from Villavicencio, at the east-
ern base of the Andes, do not agree exactly with any described form of
this variable species. They are intermediate between true sulphuratus
and rufipennis and thus are near frinitatis, from which indeed they differ
only in having the rufous and fuscous areas of wings and: particularly tail:
more sharply defined. The character is obvious enough, and, if constant,
would warrant the separation of the Villavicencio bird. A specimen from
Maripa on the lower Orinoco and another from the Orinoco delta agree
with the two from Villavicencio, while three from Trinidad are alike in
their ill-defined tail-pattern.

. This form appears to be restricted to the Cauca Valley. Occupying
a region in which the humidity more nearly resembles that of Trinidad and
the Guianas than it does-that of the arid coastal zone of northern South
America, the characters of caucensis in a degree parallel the resemblance
in climatic conditions existing between the Cauca Valley and northeastern

An adult male collected by Ring at Villavicencio differs from a British
Guiana specimen in being smaller (wing, 73 mm.), the back is browner,
the belly deeper ochraceous, the tail more rufescent basally, and the upper
tail-eoverts are practically unbarred. An immature specimen from “Napo”
agrees with the Villavicencio bird in size, and in lacking the conspicuous
bars on the tail-coverts which characterize coronatus. I have no Peruvian
specimens but the type-locality of castelnaudi lies in the same faunal zone
as Napo, and it is therefore more than probable that the Villavicencio bird
agrees with the Peruvian form.

I refer to this species three specimens from the lower part of the Sub-
tropical Zone in the Western Andes of southwest Colombia. They agree
with Sclater’s original description and differ from the form of the Tropical
Zone, which I call Mytobius sulphureipygius aureatus Bangs, in its larger
size, darker back, browner head (particularly in the female, which has the
crown largely buckthorn-brown) brownish instead of yellow under wing-
coverts, and especially, in the color of the underparts, which are olive old-
466 Bulletin American Museum of Natural History. [Vol. XXXVI,

gold or light orange-citrine, more olivaceous, therefore, than the breast of
aureatus. This color covers not only the breast but the sides and flanks
and to some extent under tail-coverts and is consequently much less re-
stricted than the corresponding color in aureatus, the yellow being confined
to the upper throat and chin, and center of the abdomen. Sclater’s
original description. (J. c.) reading in part “ pilei cristati plumis rufis, medi-
aliter aureis: Subtus fulvo-brunneus, gutture et ventre medio flavescen-
tionbus?’ clearly applies to this bird rather than to the Tropical Zone form
in which the whole abdomen and a large part of the flanks are yellow. Fur-
thermore, as the appended table indicates his measurements fit the sub-
tropical rather than tropical bird, and it is also of importance to note that
his type came from the first-named zone.

Although this bird seems clearly a zonal representative of aureatus it
nevertheless. appears to be specifically distinct. Specimens frem localities,
which like Barbacoas and Ricaurte are in approximately the same latitude
and are separated by only a few miles of space but by some 5000 feet of
altitude, show no sign of intergradation. On the other hand we have a
Bogoté skin, labeled by Sclater villosus, which agrees with our Ricaurte
specimens in pattern, but has the brown of the underparts of the same
shade as in aureatus. It would be most interesting to know whence this
specimen came. A male from Inca Mine, Peru, resembles the Ricaurte
specimen but is duller below and has the rump paler yellow.

This form appears to be restricted to the Tropical Zone of the Pacific
coast ranging northward to Costa Rica and southward to. southwestern
Ecuador. | After close examination of our thirty-six specimens from this
region, including seven from Costa Rica and six from Ecuador, I feel that
they should all be referred to one race. The more southern specimens
average somewhat more richly colored but the difference is slight and re-
peatedly bridged by individual variation.

Hellmayr (I. c.) applies the name villosus to a specimen from Névita
(whence we also have specimens), but I have given above what I trust will
be accepted as-conclusive reasons for believing that.that name should be
used for a quite different bird. Our specimens from Alto Bonito lead me to
believe that Sclater and Salvin’s record of M. villosus from Frontino should
be placed under this form.

A common species in the Subtropical Zone of all three ranges. Com-
parison of our forty-eight Colombian specimens with six from Bolivia and
Peru shows that the former differ constantly from the latter in the smaller
size, paler, narrower rump-band and greener back. Thus, as Hartlaub
(I. c.) put it some seventy years ago, the Colombian bird is “voisine de la
Muscipeta cinnamomea, d’Orb. et Lafr., mais bien differente.” Old
‘Bogota’ skins do not appear to differ from recently collected ones.

Specimens from the Pacific Coast region, chiefly from the Tropical
Zone, appear to be referable to this form, but the variation shown by three
specimens from Ecuador leaves me somewhat in doubt as to the true char-
acters of stellatus. A specimen from Lita, northwestern Ecuador, secured
through the Tring Museum is labelled ‘stellatus,’ and one from ‘western
Ecuador’ received from von Berlepsch is similarly named. Both have the
breast olive-green, as broadly so in the Lita specimen as in any example of
true ornatus. Buta bird collected by Richardson at Rio de Oro, Manavi, has
almost no olive-green on the breast, at least centrally, where the gray of the
throat and yellow of the belly are in contact. If the Lita specimen is true
470 Bulletin American Museum of Natural History. [Vol. XXXVI,
stellatus our western Colombia examples may be properly referred to that
form; if the Rio de Oro specimen is true stellatus then our western Colombia
specimens are intermediate between stellatus and ornatus. ‘They agree with
stellatus in size and in the absence of a continuous white frontal band, but
in their olive-green breast and amount of rufous in the tail are like ornatus.

places in the Tropical Zone, throughout the greater part of Colombia. We
have taken it at Tumaco but at no other point on the Pacific coast, Caldas,
being faunally a part of the Cauca Valley rather than of the coast region.
Topotypical (Lima) specimens of heterurus are larger, and the female ap-
pears to be more richly colored than specimens from Ecuador and western
Colombia, but I have not sufficient Peruvian material to reach satisfactory
conclusions in this connection.

Although this Flycatcher doubtless occurs at Villavicencio we did not
secure specimens, and I am unable therefore to state whether birds from ~
that part of Colombia show any approach to the well-marked P. r. saturatus

The receipt of additional specimens of this bird from a locality far re-
moved from that whence I had described “ Knipolegus columbianus’’, in-
duced the belief that, although the type of that “species” had been examined
by and was unknown to most of the leading ornithologists of this country,
it represented a species which had been previously described. Specimens
were therefore submitted to Count von Berlepsch who revealed its true
identity.

I still fail, however, to appreciate the bird’s relationships to typical
members of the genus Empidochanes and as before suggested (I. c.) feel
that it deserves generic separation. This species evidently occurs in the
Subtropical Zone of all three ranges.

Mitrephanes eminulus Nuts., Smith. Misc. Coll., LX, No. 3, 1912, p. 13 (Cana,
e. Panama).

After comparison with five essentially topotypical specimens of eminulus,
from Tacarcuna, eastern Panama, I refer to that form a specimen from
Monquido, a station in the Atrato Valley visited by Mrs. Kerr which I
have not been able to locate, and a fully adult male from Alto Bonito on
the western slope of the Western Andes above this valley. The first-named
specimen has somewhat less fulvous on the breast than the Panama ‘speci-
mens, and in the Alto Bonito bird there is a still further reduction of this
color, the breast being largely olive, while the abdomen is a brighter yellow.
I have no doubt that this bird is separable from eminulus, but in the ab-
sence of specimens of the western Ecuador form, berlepschi, of which emi-
nulus appears to be merely a race, I provisionally refer it to the Panama
form.

The affinities of this species appear to me to be with M. aurantiiventris
of western Panama and Costa Rica, which differs chiefly through an in-
crease in the intensity and extent of the fulvous coloring, rather than with
M. olivaceus of eastern Peru, a much larger bird with olivaceous breast
and abdomen.

Mr. Oberholser identifies a male from Florencia as agreeing essentially
with a National Museum specimen from “E. Peru” which has been com-
pared with the type. The Peruvian specimen is somewhat faded, a fact
which doubtless accounts for its being slightly paler than the Colombian
bird. This record materially extends the known range of this recently
described species.

Count von Berlepsch (Nov. Zool., 1902, p. 51) has identified as Myiar-
chus ferox venexuelensis Lawr., certain specimens of Myiarchus from the
middle lower Orinoco and comparison of our specimens from the same
region with Lawrence’s type confirms his views, so far as subspecific rela-
tionship is concerned, but in the absence of material I am unable to make
comparison with true feroz.

I now refer to this form five specimens from Villavicencio and three from
La Morelia and Florencia which, although they average darker above than
the Orinoco birds and have the bill shorter and broader, the belly deeper
yellow than the type, are evidently the representatives of venezuelensis
which, having been described merely as from ‘Venezuela,’ would appear
to come from the Orinoco region of that country and to range westward
through Colombia to the Andes. The La Morelia and Florencia birds are
somewhat darker than those from Villavicencio. The difference is in part
due to their fresher plumage and is in part no doubt racial.

Our birds agree with panamensis but in default of a topotypical series
of férox I am unable to, discuss their relation to that form. Ridgway (Bull.
50, IV, p. 612) makes panamensis a subspecies of feroz; von Berlepsch (Int.
Orn. Con., 1907, p. 477) treats it as a species. It doubtless occurs through-
out the greater part of the Tropical Zone west of the Eastern Andes,
frequenting open or semi-arid places. Two specimens from Tumaco are
grayer above than average Panama specimens, but are nearly matched
by a specimen from La Chorrera, near the southern end of the Canal Zone.

Mytarchus cephalates Tacz., P. Z. 8., 1879, p. 671 (Tambillo, Peru).

Fourteen specimens, all from the Subtropical Zone of the Western and
Central Andes, should apparently be referred to this species, which appears
not to have been previously recorded from north of Ecuador. For com- —
parison I have only a single specimen of cephalotes from the province
of Hudnuco, Peru, with which, allowing for differences due to the worn
condition of the Peruvian bird, our series agrees. Seventeen specimens
from the Tropical Zone of western Ecuador are all referable to M. pheo-
cephalus, easily distinguished from cephalotes by its olive-gray back, and
blackish crown. It is possible that this species may be a zonal repre-
sentative of feroa, but all the birds in our series can readily be distinguished
from ferox panamensis (which occurs in the Tropical Zone of the same
range of the Andes whence came our specimens of cephalotes), by their
blacker mandibles, darker wings and tail, and, particularly, by the con-
spicuous, whitish margins to the outer vanes of the tertials and outer pair
of tail-feathers.

1911, p. 1187 (Pueblo Rico, 5200 ft.; Noanamd).

Without a series of eastern Bolivian birds typical of tuberculifer (Lair.
& d’Orb.) I cannot satisfactorily treat our Colombian series of small, black-
headed Flycatchers of the tuberculifer-nigriceps group. It seems unques-
tionable, however, that the bird of which we have forty-five specimens from
western Ecuador, western Colombia, Cauca and Magdalena Valleys, Pan-
ama, Santa Marta, Buena Vista (above Villavicencio), Merida and north-
western Venezuela and Trinidad belongs to a single species.

The Ecuador specimens are topotypical of nigriceps, while those from
Venezuela and Trinidad are referred by Hellmayr! to tuberewlifer. Ac-
cepting birds from these localities, therefore, as respectively representing
nigriceps and tuberculifer, and aside from slight differences in size, which
doubtless would be paralleled in a series of tuberculifer taken from Bolivia
to Venezuela, the Trinidad and Venezuela birds (8 specimens) may be
distinguished from the Ecuador birds (5 specimens) by having the crown
fuscous-black instead of pure black, the back grayish olive-green, instead of
olive-green while the crown is less clearly defined from the back; the belly
averages paler, but there is here much variation. In the size and shape of
the bill, color of the wing-bars, and extent of cinnamon on the inner wing-
quills, individual variation is so great that geographical variation, if it exists,
is obscured. ,

Accepting, then, these two series:as standards for comparison, it ap-
pears, as might be expected, that specimens from the Pacific Coast of
Colombia are typical of nigriceps and a single old skin from the Panama
R. R. line is evidently also nigriceps. It is surprising, however, to find
the form of the humid Pacific Coast in the Cauca and Magdalena Valleys,
but specimens from Cali, Rio Frio and below Andalucia unquestionably
belong to it.

Two specimens from Buena Vista, near the eastern base of the Eastern
Andes are intermediate between nigriceps from Ecuador and tuberculifer
from Venezuela and Trinidad; the back is less green than the former and
not so gray as in the latter, and the crown while lacking the intense black
of nigriceps is not as fuscous as in the birds from Venezuela and Trinidad.
On geographical grounds, however, these birds should be referred to tu-
berculifer rather than to nigriceps.

Santa Marta birds (19 specimens) agree with those from eastern Vene-
zuela and Trinidad.

headed form of the Caribbean coast region, Trinidad, and the Guianas,
while those from this zone at the base of the Eastern Andes are referable
to the yellow-headed form, P. e. berlepschi. Both races, therefore, are
found in the Bogoté region and their occurrence together in ‘Bogota’ col-
lections has doubtless led to the belief that the characters separating them
are individual rather than racial.

With somewhat over one hundred males before me representing the
greater part of the geographic range of the species, I find no difficulty, how-
ever, in distinguishing two perfectly valid forms the distribution of which,
aside from the light here thrown on birds from the Bogoté region, is cor-
rectly given by Ridgway (Bull. 50, IV, pp. 748, 748). Females of erythro-
cephala are yellower, particularly below, than those of berlepschi.

Doctor Hellmayr kindly calls my attention to the fact that the sub-
specific name proposed for this race is pre-occupied by Pipra mentalis minor

familiar, but the name of which I had overlooked in this connection. I
therefore suggest the name Pipra leucocilla minimus for the Cocal form.

aside from being larger, are less bluish black than recently collected speci-

of P. 1. leucocilla. Two young males collected by Fuertes, one having the
testes slightly, the other much enlarged, have the crown, sides of the head

We have found this species only in the Western Andes and lower Cauca
slope of the Central Andes. At Buenavista it descends as low as 1200 it.

The most careful comparison of eight males from western Colombia with
two from Nanegal (type-locality of corunulatus) and two from Gualea,
Ecuador, fails to reveal characters on which to base a Cauca region form.
Both Colombian and Ecuadorian series contain birds with “tobacco-brown”
and “dark red” (cf. Hellm., Gen. Av., Pt. IX, 1910, p. 16) crests. The
yellow of the wings averages deeper in the Colombian birds, but the dif-
ference at best is slight and entirely overlapped by individual variation.
Possibly our specimens from Gallera and Buenavista may not typically
represent “ bellus” of the Cauca region, though we have not found in other
species any difference between specimens from Gallera and the Andes west |
of Cali. Furthermore, a specimen from Las Lomitas, essentially topo-
typical of bellus, can be almost exactly matched with one from Gualea. I
detect no evidence of intergradation between this species and M. chrysop-
terus of the Eastern Andes.

Cali, agree in color, size, length of primaries and wing-formula. It is to
be noted that San Antonio is in the Subtropical Zone. There is; however,
a possibility of the specimen from this locality having been taken in the
Tropical Zone below the crest of the ridge known as San Antonio. In any
event, the bird is typical, showing no approach to the long outer primaried
C. a. altera which occurs in the Chocé Valley at the western base of the
Western Andes, a fact in distribution which, in connection with the nature
of the characters separating the two birds, suggests, in my opinion, their
specific distinctness.

Specimens from Antioquia have the long beard and wing characters of
abditivus, of which we have a large topotypical series, but the abdominal
region is somewhat grayer and the white areas show a faint but unmistak-
able tint of yellow indicating an approach toward flaveolus, with which, as
below stated, I believe this form intergrades.

A specimen from Puerto Valdivia is the most western record for this
species in northern Colombia. Between this point and Barbacoas in south-
western Colombia it is unknown té6 occur. These Manakins inhabit rather
open, scrubby places where their buzzing fight quickly calls attention to
them, and their absence from collections made in western Colombia is

_ almost conclusive evidence that they are not found in this region.

It may be suggested that Manacus vitiellinus replaces Manacus manacus
in the region in question, but the occurrence of both forms at Puerto Val-
divia is of importance in this connection. It should be added, however,
486 . Bulletin American Museum of Natural History. (Vol. XXXVI,

wing longer and more pointed, tail shorter, outer primaries narrower less regularly
curved and projecting 8 to 10 mm. beyond the tips of secondaries.

This race appears to have a very restricted range. No form of the
species has been recorded from the Pacific coast of Colombia north of Bar-
bacoas nor have we met with one in the Cauca Valley. To the south
its range can extend but a short distance since at Esmeraldas, Ecuador
southward, the quite different M. m. leucochlamys (Bull. A. M. N. H.,

under that race specimens from Malena, from near Medellin, and Puerto
Valdivia show, in possessing a faint tint of yellow on the anterior under-_
parts and nape, an evident approach toward flaveolus. The difference
between the two forms is further bridged by three specimens from: the
vicinity of Honda which are much less strongly tinged with yellow than are

specimens from Chicoral, one of which has the chin-tuft more elongate,

as in abditivus. Our material, therefore, indicates that in the eighty-odd

miles between Malena and Honda, in which the humid Magdalena Valley

merges into the arid Magdalena Valley, abditivus merges into flaveolus.

Inhabits the Tropical Zone of the Pacific coast and, much to my sur-

rather than with M. v. millert from the lower part of the river.

I can discover no constant difference between Colombia and Panama
specimens but possibly the belly averages paler in specimens from the Canal
Zone region, while the orange areas are most deeply colored in a specimen
from Chorrera on the southern side of the Isthmus, facts which seem to
indicate an approach toward M. aurantiacus.

An adult male from Noanamé agrees in size with specimens of TY. s.

mens in color and in the pattern of the tail-markings, the black area on the
inner vane of the outer feather being separated from the shaft by a white
line connecting the white basal and apical portions of the feather. On the
other hand specimens from Dabeiba and Puerto Valdivia agree in size with
C. columbiana (wing, 124 mm.) but the tail-markings are not so near those
of columbiana as in the Névita specimen, the black on the inner vane of
the outer feather reaching to the shaft, though by no means so broad there
as on the inner border of the vane.

Our series of eight topotypical (Santa Marta) specimens of this form
differ from Chapada, Matto Grosso, specimens in having the black frontal
band slightly narrower and in being smaller, while the females average
darker.

to P. cinnamomeus. and also to P. rufus (Bodd.) ( = P. cinereus Auct.)
but cannot be properly referred to either. Compared with specimens of
cinnamomeus taken at the same season on the Pacific coast it is slightly
smaller (wing, 70; tail, 52; culmen, 13.8 mm.) and is much paler through-
out, the lores and underparts being whitish faintly tinged with buff, the
underparts pale tawny rather than rich rufous tawny, while the wing-
coverts are uniform tawny or rufous tawny without trace of paler margins:
In this character the bird agrees with the female of P. rufus but it is much
paler below than any female of that species in our collection and is decidedly
larger, the bill especially being heavier, the tail longer, the tail-feathers
wider. ::Furthermore, there is less difference between the color of the head
and back than in rufus. Nor can it be considered the female of P. magda-
lene: which is less rufous above and has the wing-coverts conspicuously mar-
gined arid, in the male at least, the cap obviously deeper than the back.
The discovery of the male of this species will be awaited with interest.

ochraceous, tawny, the nape slate-gray; the crown of nearly the same shade as the
back.

(8226) Pachyrhamphus polychropterus niger (Syiz).
Pachyrhynchus niger Sprx., Av. Bras., II, 1825, p. 38, pl. xlv, fig. 1 (Rio Ica),

Two adult males from La Morelia and Florencia respectively, have
the rump, upper tail-coverts and ventral region wholly black, and are evi-
dently typical of this form. Four males from Buena Vista and Villavi-
cencio also have the rump and upper tail-coverts black, but the ventral
region is more or less grayish, and these birds thus show an approach
toward the form of niger which inhabits Trinidad. Of this form we have
five adult males from Trinidad. Compared with twelve adult males from
Santa Marta (Bonda) the Trinidad birds are black rather than-gray below,
while the upper tail-coverts are black slightly edged with grayish instead
of pure gray. The differences are apparent at a glance and the distinct-
ness of the two forms is beyond question. If the name cinereiventris Scl.
can be properly applied to Santa Marta birds it is certainly not applicable
1917.] Chapman, Distribution of Bird-life in Colombia. 493

to specimens from Trinidad which, although not typical of niger are far
nearer to that form than to the form from Santa Marta. If, as Hellmayr
suggests (Archiv. fiir Naturg., 1912, p. 90), Sclater’s type did not come
from Santa Marta then the bird from Santa Marta requires a new name.
Ridgway (Bull. U. S. N. M., 50, IV, 831) has already clearly stated this
case, but I cannot agree with him that two adult males in the American
Museum collection from San Antonio and Cumanacoa, Venezuela, respec-
tively, are nearer to niger than to cineretventris. In the color of the under-
parts they are fairly intermediate, but in the grayness of the rump and upper
tail-coverts they are obviously nearer cinereiventris. An adult male from ,
El Pilar, Venezuela, however, is exactly like specimens from Trinidad.
But whatever. may be the status of the Venezuelan bird those inhabiting
Santa Marta and Trinidad represent two quite unlike races.

Fourteen specimens (12 males, 2 females) from the Subtropical Zone
of the Eastern and Western Andes are to be referred to this form, the exact
status of which appears not to have been satisfactorily determined. The
gray nuchal collar supposed to be diagnostic of the species is well developed
in some specimens and wholly wanting in others from the same locality,
(San Antonio) and such birds differ from true cinéreiventris only in their
larger size and paler underparts. It is quite probable that the two forms
intergrade.

that the difference shown is, in part at least, seasonal.

Char. subsp.— Similar to Rupicola peruviana peruviana Lath., but male with the
anterior parts of the body, and particularly the crest, more orange in color, orange-
chrome rather than flame-scarlet, the gray of the tertials more restricted not wholly
concealing the subapical black of the underlying feather; general coloration of female
more orange.

Inhabits the Subtropical Zone of the Central and Western Andes. It
is rare or absent near frequented places, but in the rocky gorges of certain
tributaries of the Magdalena near San Agustin Miller found seven nests
and secured the eggs, young in various stages, and a large series of adults
in the latter part of April, 1912. The specimens recorded from Buena
Vista were brought us in the flesh by a native hunter who claimed to have
secured them in the heavy forest on the shores of the Rio Negro. This
locality was at an altitude of about 1600 feet, and. the occurrence of the
species there would imply its presence in the Tropical rather than the Sub-
tropical Zone, in which alone we had heretofore found it as well as R. san-
guinolenta. Subsequently a specimen was received from a native whom
in December, 1913, we sent from Bogoté to the Meta, and labeled by him
“Barrigon, Dec. 21, 1912, macho.” Barrigon is in heavy gallery forest,
but is some sixty miles east of Villavicencio and hence on the Ilanos.

Richardson also has sent us five specimens taken at an altitude of 2000
ft. at Zamora, southeastern Ecuador, and in light of this evidence it ap-
pears that on the eastern slope of the Eastern Andes this bird may at times
be found in the Tropical Zone, though we should prefer to have the Barrigon
record confirmed before believing that the bird is found sixty miles from the
mountains.

Comparison of our fresh specimens from the Bogota region with old

. ‘Bogota’ skins shows that in the latter the black areas are somewhat duller
and the orange not quite so deep, but the difference on the whole is very
slight. The same remarks hold true on comparison of freshly collected
Zamora specimens with old skins labeled “ Ambato, Ecuador.”

The exceptionally large series of Colombian birds now available shows
that all the specimens received from that country are referable to the form
1917.) Chapman, Distribution of Bird-life in Colombia. 497

described as aurea though none is quite as richly colored as the type and
topotype from Salento in the Central Andes. To this race should also be
referred the specimens collected by Richardson at Zamora in southeastern
Ecuador. It is more than probable, therefore, that specimens from north-
ern Peru also agree with these Ecuadorian birds when, if the name peru-
viana is based on the bird of this part of Peru, aurea would become a pure
synonym of it. Examination, however, of the descriptions and particu-
larly plate (P]. Enl. 745) on which Latham (Index Orn. II, p. 555) based
his name peruviana, shows that it is applicable to the bird in which the ex-
posed surfaces of the tertials are wholly gray, as they are in sanguinolenta,
whereas in not one specimen of the very large number of males which I
have seen from Ecuador and Colombia does this condition occur, all having
the gray of the tertials so restricted that the subapical black area is visible
beyond the gray tip of the overlying feather. This is a definite and con-
stant character and aside from differences in intensity of the orange areas,
clearly separates the birds of Ecuador and Colombia from those of at least
southern Peru to which Buffon’s plate apparently makes the name peruviana
applicable.

Peruvian specimens from Inca Mine, Rio Inambari, Machu Picchu and
Rio Cosirem north of the last-named locality agree and differ from the
Colombian bird as described above, but agree with Bolivian specimens
from Locotal. If the Peruvian birds represent true peruviana, Rupicola
* saturata Cab. & Hein. evidently becomes a synonym of it.

Evidently restricted to the Subtropical Zone of the Western Andes.
It is rare in the mountains above Cali but apparently more common in less
frequented regions. Our specimens agree with others from Gualea, Ecuador,
which may be considered topotypical. In the Cauca region one may look
across the Cauca Valley from the home of sanguinolenta, in the Western
Andes, to that of aurea in the Central Andes, but the birds are more unlike
here than are Bolivian specimens from West Andean specimens. In other
words. the form.of peruviana nearest sanguinolenta is the one which, geo-
graphically, is farthest removed from it.

specimens, the tertials being not only margined, but broadly tipped with

ence noted may be individual or due to age. Should it be racial, the name

Char. subsp.— Similar to Pheoprogne tapera tapera (Gmel.), but underparts
without the median line of spots, guttate or broad central markings, which reach from
breast to belly in that species; the pectoral band generally more pronounced.

Found by us only in the Tropical Zone of the Magdalena Valley and in
the Caribbean coast region. It was not secured in the Cauca Valley, nor
on the Pacific coast, but Mr. Cherrie and I secured specimens at Duran,
near Guayaquil, during a brief stop there in May, 1916.

The receipt of additional materia! since this bird was described, places
its status in doubt. At the time of description I had seen only one bird
from north of the Amazon which showed the median pectoral spots char-
acteristic of P. t. tapera; now, however, we have two more collected by Mrs,
Kerr on the Sinu River, in northern Colombia, which are apparently typi-
cal of the Brazilian race, that is, have a median row of larger, well-defined
fuscous spots from the breast to the abdomen. The occurrence of these
specimens at the northern limit of the range ascribed to the form which I
have described as immaculata, might be thought to invalidate the claims
to recognition of that bird. The fact remains, however, that evidently
without regard to age, or season, we have two quite unlike types of Pheo-
progne tapera, one of which is the characteristic form in the southern part of
the range of the species, the other characteristic of the northern part. Thus,
every one of twenty specimens from southern Brazil has the median line of
spots strongly developed; while sixteen of nineteen specimens from Vene-
zuela, Colombia and western Ecuador, are without these spots.

I confess I cannot explain this unusual state of affairs. The character
by which these forms are differentiated appears to be of specific, rather

‘than of subspecific value. There is no intergradation between the two
types such as we find in representative geographic races. The two north
Colombia specimens are as typical of the spotted-breasted race as are birds
from southern Brazil. Possibly they may, independently of environment,
spontaneously exhibit a character which has been fixed in all the more south-
ern individuals of the species, and which in time may be found in all the
northern individuals as well. The case is as interesting as it is exceptional,
and it is greatly to be hoped that material with which to explain it may soon
be forthcoming. Meanwhile, it seems desirable to recognize, at least pro-
visionally, the race for which I have proposed the name immaculata, and as
an aid to the elucidation of the problem it presents, IT add a list with data
of all our specimens of both forms.

Common in the Tropical Zone of the entire Magdalena Valley and also
at the eastern base of the Eastern Andes at Villavicencio, and doubtless
as far south as the junction of Jlanos with Amazonian forest, where it is
replaced by S. r. ruficollts, which Miller secured at La Morelia.

In the region between the Magdalena and Cauca Valleys intergrades
occur, most of which are nearer uropygialis but some of which are very
close to aqualis. While the differences between the two are obvious, there

is enough seasonal variation to require the use of wholly comparable ma-
terial in reaching valid conclusions concerning the relationships of speci-
mens from areas of intergradation. Fortunately we are provided with
typical seasonally comparable series of both forms, but the determinations
made with this material produce results which, taken literally, might be
most misleading. Thus we have specimens referable to equalis from
Dabeiba, Puerto Valdivia and Rio Frio in the Cauca Valley; while specimens
referable to uropygialis were taken at La Frijolera, Barro Blanco, Salento,
and Rio Toché. The fact that all the specimens of equalis are from the
Tropical Zone while all those of uropygialis are from the Subtropical Zone
may have some significance, though I am at a loss to understand why in
this area of intergradation uropygialis should be a subtropical species while
in the region where it is most typically developed it is found only in the
tropics. All our specimens of equalis, on the other hand are from the
Tropical Zone.

Possibly the fact that all our Subtropical Zone specimens of wropygialis _
or intergrades which are nearer that form, are non-breeding birds taken in
October and November, may indicate that they are migrants from the
Pacific coast region. The question can be decided only by further field
work and comparison of breeding birds from all the areas concerned. Mean-
while I list our specimens, according to their apparent identity.

Stelgidopieryx ruficollis uropygialis Hetim., P. Z. S., 1911, p. 1093 (Sipi).

As might be expected, this is the form of S. ruficollis which occurs on
the Pacific coast region of Colombia and Ecuador, from which it has al-
ready been recorded by others; but it is ‘somewhat surprising to find one
of these richly colored forms which characterize the Pacific lowland, ex-
tending its range into the Subtropical Zone of the Central as well as Western
Andes. A specimen from Salento and two from Rio Toché, all taken in
October, three from Barro Blanco (November), and one from La Frijolera
(January) are much nearer to uropygialis than to aqualis and are therefore
listed under that race. Whether they are migrants or merely intergrades
from a general area of intergradation I am unable to say, (See also re-
marks under preceding race).

A Tropical Zone species which doubtless ranges throughout the greater
part of Colombia. We have taken it only in the Magdalena Valley, but
Hellmayr (1. ¢.) records it from the Cauca Valley. It is probable that
it also occurs at the eastern base of the Andes since we have several speci-
mens from the Middle Orinoco,

It is worthy of note that the Gnatcatcher of the Pacific coast from
Esmeraldas southward is a bird of the bikincate group, of Panama, etc., a
form as yet unknown from western Colombia.

of all three ranges of the Andes. Since describing a supposed form of this

the conclusion that there is but one race of this Wren in Colombia. Un-

fortunately I have but one specimen from Antioquia and it agrees with the
figure of the type in having the back barred. I have now, however, five
specimens from Laguneta and the region above Salento (alt. 9000 ft.) the
fauna of which is essentially Antioquian, which can be matched by my
original series of seven specimens from the Andes west of Popayan. While
none of the Laguneta birds has the back barred as in the Antioquian bird, .
two of them have faint traces of this marking (as do also two of the West
Andean birds) and in view of the locality whence they came it is probable
that they represent. true olivascens, the barring on the -back of which is
probably a variable character.

Turning now to three specimens from the Eastern Andes, including
one from near Bogoté, we find that they can be matched by specimens from
the two Cauca region series just mentioned. Only a faint indication of
dorsal bars is evident, but as it appears that these bars may be wanting
in specimens from the faunal region whence olivascens was described it
seems probable that they form an individual rather than racial marking.

The black eye-stripe, to which Matschie (I. c.) refers as characterizing
olivascens, is apparently a darkening of the loral and postocular region which
has been emphasized by the artist in Sharpe’s plate (l. ¢.). This marking
is present in some and absent in other specimens from the same locality and
is clearly individual.

Taken as a whole the Cauca series of twelve specimens presents consid-
erable variation in color, some individuals being much more rufescent than
others. Only four of the whole series of seventeen birds have white on the
forehead, and in only one of these does it approach the extent shown by the
bird in Sharpe’s plate.

foreback, unbarred wings and tail. From H. minor, of the lower Orinoco, it
may be known by its more chestnut back, etc. and black foreback.

Heleodytes harterti Bery., Ornis, XIV, 1907, p. 347 (San José, R. Dagua, Col.).
Heleodytes albobrunneus harierti Hatim., P. Z. 8., 1911, p. 1088 (El Tigre, Rio
Tamané).

A topotype from San José shows admirably the characters of blackish
back, wings and tail on which this race is founded, and they are shown
almost equally well by a specimen from Dabeiba on the east side of the
Atrato Valley, and one from El Real, eastern Panama, while a molting
specimen taken May 16, 1915, at Cituro on the Cupe River, eastern Panama,
is essentially a duplicate of the type so far as its new plumage is concerned,
but the still unshed, worn rectrices and remiges agree with those of Panama
specimens of albobrunneus. It does not follow that harterti is not a tenable
form since even in fresh plumage, albobrunneus is not so dark as harterti,
but it does follow that the differences between the two are bridged by sea-
sonal variation in harterti, which, in worn plumage, cannot be distinguished
from albobrunneus. A November specimen from the Rio Salaqui, a tribu-
tary of the lower Atrato exactly matches a “Panama” bird which is un-
fortunately without date of collection, and, in this instance, the Panama
specimen is in somewhat more worn plumage.

In juvenal plumage the crown is blackish or brownish gray (La Vieja,
o', @ Oct.; Tapaliza,?, Feb. 19) and with the advance toward maturity
it passes through a mottled stage (Rio Salaqui, Mch. 13, o; El Real, Dec.
28, 9). In’ adult plumage both sexes have the entire head white. In
addition to the Colombian specimens listed below we have five from eastern
Panama.

Campylorhynchus hypostictus Goup, P. Z. 8., 1855, p. 68 (R. Ucayali, Peru).

Found by us only in Amazonian Colombia, but occurring in Bogoté
collections. Our six specimens have the outer webs of the wing-quills and
also the outer tail-feathers with rusty marks or broken bars, a character
wanting or but slightly suggested in five specimens from Peru and Bolivia.
In a Bogota skin, however, this rusty marking is barely evident in the wings
and absent from the tail. If the Colombian bird proves to be separable it
would stand as Heleodytes turdinus striaticollis Scl. (P. Z. S., 1857, p. 272,

Santa Marta (including the type of pardus Scl.) and one from Puerto
Cabello, Venezuela, to which I assume the name nuchalis (Cab.) is applica-
ble. The specimens from the lower Orinoco are smaller and possibly
represent brevirostris Lawr., which, if we may judge from the measurements
accompanying the original description, is a smaller bird than nuchalis.

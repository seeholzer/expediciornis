Seu. & Saty., P. Z.8., 1879, p. 505 (Medellin); Hutum., Jbid., 1911, p. 1120 (Pueblo
Rico, 5200 ft. ).

Common in the Subtropical Zone of the Western Andes; one specimen
from the western slope of the Central Andes.

Popayan birds are topotypes and the others, except those from Ricaurte
and Barbacoas, agree with them.

Five specimens from Ricaurte (alt. 4500 ft.), a locality near Barbacoas
where the coastal forest ends, and one from as low even as Barbacoas, are
fairly intermediate between this form and the next.

Saltator atripennis caniceps Cuapm., Bull. A. M. N. H., XXXII, 1914, p. 182
(Fusugasugé, Col.).

Char. subsp— Similar to S. a. atripennis but crown largely gray instead of
largely black; exposed portions of inner tertials wholly olive-green, throat and
breast with no wash of buffy, under tail-coverts paler, bill averaging heavier and
more inflated laterally.

Inhabits the Temperate Zone of the Eastern Andes and southward into
Ecuador (Gualea). It is not surprising therefore to find that five specimens
from Ricaurte (alt. 5000 ft.), a locality in southwestern Colombia on the
Ecuadorian line, are intergrades. The bill in these Ricaurte birds agrees
with that of caniceps, the color of crown more nearly resembles that of
atr¢pennis while the tertials are more like those of caniceps. The buffy
throat-mark is barely evident in four specimens and absent in one, but the
cinnamon-buff under tail-coverts are unquestionably those of atripennis.

The present case furnishes an exception to the rule that the affinities of
west Ecuadorian forms are with those of the Cauca region rather than with
those from the Bogoté region.

Inhabits the Tropical Zone at the eastern base of the Eastern Andes at
least as far north as Villavicencio. Aside from being slightly smaller (<7,
wing, 96 mm.) our specimens agree with others from Peru and Bolivia.
Although three of our specimens come from the heart of the east ‘Bogota’
region, this species does not appear to have been before recorded from
Colombia.

’ An abundant bird in the Temperate Zone of the Eastern Andes occurring
in great flocks on the Bogoté Savanna and descending less commonly to the
upper portion of the Subtropical Zone. Old ‘ Bogota’ skins are more yellow
above than freshly collected specimens. All of our examples have the tail
yellow at the base, the principal character by which they are distinguished
from S. nigricauda of the Central: Andes.

Our specimens are chiefly from the Subtropical Zone in all three ranges,
and arid or open portions of the Temperate Zone in the eastern range.

Ranges from the Tropical to the Temperate Zone. Specimens with
black as well as black and white tails are included in our series of adult males
from most of the localities mentioned, as follows:

Western Andes: Caldas, one, in molt, outer feathers only remaining but
with as much white as in croceus; oné, no white in outer feathers, second pair
as in croceus, third pair with but little white on one side, almost none on the
other. Central Andes: Miraflores, three, all with tail essentially as in
eroceus; Barro-Blanco, one, tail black; El Eden, one, outer pair of feathers,
one as in eroceus, one black; second pair both white, as in croceus, third pair
black; Chicoral, one, two outer pairs of feathers with but little white;
La Candela, one, same as last, one with little white in outer pair only; San
Agustin, one, a little white in outer feather on one side, the same amount in
second feather on the other side. Eastern Andes: Above Honda, one, tail
wholly black; vicinity of Bogoté, ten, seven with tail wholly black, one with
1917] Chapman, Distribution of Bird-life in Colombia. 565

white along the shaft of the two outer feathers, one with outer feathers as in
croceus, a much smaller amount on the next pair, one with two outer feath-
ers with white quadrate patches on one side, the corresponding feathers on
the other side black; Quetame, tail wholly black; Buena Vista, two, tail
wholly black, one, small amount of white in outer pair, one, small amount
of white in one of second pair; Andalucia, one, wholly black; one, two outer
pairs as in croceus. In addition to the Colombian birds listed below we have
one from Gualea, Ecuador, in which the three outer pairs of rectrices have
as much white as in croceus. It thus appears that only five birds in our
series of thirty-five males have the tail with white as in croceus (they are
considerably paler below than Chiriqui specimens), seventeen have no white
on the tail and fourteen are more or less intermediate and of these thirteen
have the tail assymetrically marked with white. All the white-tailed
(= “croceus”’) specimens are from the Western Andes and western slope
of the Central Andes; all but one of the black-tailed specimens (= columbia-
nus) are from the Eastern Andes or country at their base, while intermediates
occur throughout practically the entire region represented by our specimens.
It is evident that we have here a complicated case not to be accounted for by
geographic or individual variation, while the results of hybridization could
be rendered apparent along so Jong a “front” only by assuming that range
extension in these forms has been from east to west and vice versa. Thus a
black-tailed eastern form has longitudinally invaded the range of a white-
tailed western form, which in turn has entered the home of the black-tailed
form. Only this theory occurs to me as a possible explanation of this puz-
zling case, but more material is needed before we will be in a position to
settle satisfactorily the status of these birds.

Char. subsp.— Similar to A. s. australis but darker, black central areas to feathers

larger, chestnut areas smaller and darker, edgings to feathers grayer, less buffy.

Known only from three specimens taken at Cali. In view of the some-
what restricted character of the avifauna of the Tropical Zone of the Cauca
Valley it is somewhat surprising to find there two species of Sparrows of
sedentary habits. The present species appears not to have been recorded
elsewhere on the South American mainland, though a form of it (A. s. cart-
bews Hart.) has been described from the islands of Curacao and Bonaire.

(3855a) Myospiza manimbe columbiana Chapm.

Myospiza manimbe columbiana Cuarm., Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., XXX,
1912, p. 162 (Cali, ‘Col.).

Char. subsp.— Upperparts much darker and more broadly streaked than in
M.m. manimbe, the crown and back of about the same color.

Apparently confined to the Tropical Zone. We have five specimens from
Cali, and three from La Manuelita, in the Cauca Valley, one from near
Honda and five from Chicoral, in the Magdalena Valley. The latter, as
before remarked (7. c.), are paler than columbiana and more nearly resemble
specimens from the middle Orinoco region.

(8856a) Myospiza cherriei Chapm.

Myospiza cherriei Cuapm., Bull. A. M. N. H., XXXIT, 1914, p. 183 (Villavi-

Char. sp.— Similar to Myospiza manimbe but much paler, the plumage with no
chestnut, the crown essentially like the back, the breast with no dusky band, the
yellow of head more extensive, encircling the eye and basally crossing the forehead,
outer primary shorter, equalling the seventh instead of the sixth (from without);
outer tail-feathers shorter; bill more slender, the mandible plumbeous rather than
brownish in color.

Known only from the llanos at the base of the Eastern Andes.

This species is intermediate between Myospiza manimbe (Licht.) and -
M. aurifrons (Spix) (= peruviana auct.), in fact, it materially closes the gap
between these quite unlike forms. In the general coloration of the upperparts
it more nearly resembles manimbe, but in its strongly graduated tail, white
underparts, extent of yellow on the head, color and shape of the bill, it
appears to be more nearly related to awrifrons. Its wing formula is inter-
mediate in character, the outer primary being shorter than in manimbe and
longer than in aurifrons.

Brachyspiza capensis peruviana Aten, Bull. A. M. N. H., XIII, 1900, p. 164
(Santa Marta).

This widely distributed and abundant wayside bird ranges from the
upper borders of the arid Tropical Zone through arid or deforested areas
in the Subtropical Zone and throughout the Temperate Zone. Probably
it is most numerous in the last-named zone. The lowest elevation at which
we have met it is Caldas (alt. 1800 ft.), the arid pocket on the west slope of
the Western Andes. It is found all along the trail to Cali, in the Cauca
Valley, and on the Central Andes to timberline. It was not observed in
the Magdalena Valley at Honda, nor did we encounter it in ascending
the western slope of the eastern range until we had reached an altitude
of 5000 feet, a few miles east of Guaduas. From this point it was com-
mon: upward to the Bogota Savanna where it is one of the-most characteris-
tic species, and thence eastward over the pass (alt. 10700 ft.) on the trail
to Villavicencio, and down this trail to the vicinity of Monteredondo (alt.
4600 ft.) where the arid Subtropical Zone meets the upper border of the
humid Tropical Zone.

Eighty specimens from the region here outlined represent but one race,
which comparison with eight Peruvian birds, including four topotypes from
Lima, supports Mr. Ridgway’s conclusion ! that Colombian birds are most
nearly related to the form from western Peru. Sixteen specimens from
Costa Rica and Chiriqui (B. ¢. costaricensis (Allen) are darker and smaller
than Peruvian birds and have more black on the throat, but the range of
individual variation is so great that to recognize a northern form would make
it difficult to name exactly specimens from most of the territory between
Peru and Costa Rica, and I follow Ridgway (J. c.) in applying the name
peruviana to the birds from the whole area.

Of general distribution in the Tropical Zone but apparently wanting in
the Cauca Valley. On the Pacific coast A. c. chrysoma reaches southwest
Colombia but no representative of the group has been recorded from between
Barbacoas and Panama.

Specimens from the western base of the Eastern Andes (vicinity of Honda)
appear to be inseparable from those from near the eastern base of the range
(Buena Vista), though on both sides the birds are restricted to the Tropical
Zone. Accepting Hellmayr’s designation of the type-locality for this species
as “Bogoté” ! these birds are typical of conirostris, and I place with them
Santa Marta specimens (A. canens Bangs) though they average slightly
browner above. Six specimens from Bermudez, Venezuela, average some-
what smaller but show no difference in color from the Honda and Buena -
Vista birds. If they properly represent venezuelensis (described from Puerto
Cabello) I am unable to appreciate its characters. Todd (Ann. Carnegie
Mus. 1912, p. 199) and Hellmayr (J. c.) consider canens to be synonymous
with venezuelensis, an opinion with which I agree though my material shows
canens to differ somewhat from conirostris, while venezuelensis appears to be
identical with it. Specimens from Chicoral, on the west side of the Mag-
dalena Valley, and 1200 feet above Honda, are slightly larger than Honda
specimens. I think that we are warranted, however, in accepting either
Honda or Buena Vista birds as topotypical. The affinities of richmondi, the
Panama and Central American bird, appear to be with chrysoma rather than
with conirostris, which differs from both the preceding in having gray in the
back and less yellow in the wing-coverts.

Arremonops conirostris inecpectata CHapM., Bull. A. M. N. H., XOCXIII, 1914,
p. 184 (Andalucia, w. slope, Cen. Andes, 3000 ft.).

Char. subsp.— Similar to A. ¢. conirostris but wing shorter; in general color of
the body resembling conirostris, but breast paler and supraloral stripe whiter, wings
and tail more nearly like those of A. c. chrysoma, the shoulder bright lemon-chrome,
the wing-quills, including the outer primary, margined externally with yellowish
increasing in brightness from within outwardly. Average, three males, wing, 69;
tail, 66; one female, wing, 65; tail, 63 mm.

In view of the stability shown by Arremonops conirostris conirostris
through a wide area, the appearance of this form so near the type-locality
of that race is surprising and inexplicable. Specimens of conzrostris from
Honda, at the western base of the Eastern Andes, agree minutely in color
and size with others from the eastern base of the same range, though these
areas are separated by three life-zones making actual contact impossible.

Nevertheless, within the same river valley, and in the same faunal area,
this well-marked race, the characters of which are supported by eight adults
and five juvenal specimens, occurs. In no other instance have we found
birds common to both Honda and the region west of and below Andalucia,
to differ geographically from one another, arid one is led to believe that pos-
sibly inexpectata is not strictly a geographical variant of conirostris, or at any
rate has had its origin from some other source than the Honda region. The
bird’s resemblance to chrysoma of western Ecuador should be considered in
this connection, and the apparent isolation of the latter form is also of sig-
nificance. Possibly like some other birds from the Upper Magdalena at
Andalucia, it has crossed from the eastern to the western side of the Andes
at this point. Miller, however, sends no specimens of Arremonops from the
Caqueté region.

The range of this race, heretofore known only from western Ecuador, is
now extended to southwestern Colombia through Richardson’s capture of
six specimens.. No form of Arremonops has been recorded from the Pacific
coast of Colombia north of Tumaco, but the species appears again in Pan-
ama and Central America as A. chrysoma richmondi. This form differs from
chrysoma mainly in having the back and tail with a brownish tinge, the wings

(3910a) Pseudochloris citrina antioquiz subsp. nov.

Char. subsp.— Similar to P. c. citrina but upperparts very much darker, the
shaft-streaks of the back blacker their margins hair-brown rather than buffy brown;
remiges and rectrices black rather than fuscous; female with the crown largely hair-
brown instead of Saccardo’s umber. Males differ from the type (male) of P. brownt
in having “ the chest slightly duller; the belly brighter and clearer yellow; the yellow
of forehead less diffused and not extending as far backward toward the nape; the
nape darker; the back much darker, the rectrices and remiges of a deeper, richer
color.” (T. Barbour in. Wit.). .

Type.— 134,194 Am. Mus. Nat. Hist. o ad. Barro Blanco (7200 ft.), Antioquia,

This race is known only from the type-locality whence we have three
adult males and two adult females. All are much alike in the color of the
upperparts, wings, and tail, indicating that the dark color of these parts is
characteristic. Of P. citrina citrina I have only one female, which, however,
is in fresh plumage and exactly comparable with one of the Barro Blanco
specimens.
572 Bulletin American Museum of Natural History. [Vol. XXXVI,

Of P. brown I have only one immature female (?), but comparison with
the type and three female topotypes of the species has been made for me by
Mr. Thomas Barbour.

Our single specimen of brown? (Onaca, Santa Marta) in the general color
of the upperparts, wings and tail is much nearer our one specimen of citrina
than either is to antioguie. The specimen of citrina is from Mt. Roraima,
whence Sharpe (Cat. Bds. B. M. XII, p. 779) records additional specimens.

Brabourne & Chubb, however, (Bds. S. A., I, p. 381) include Guiana in
the range of brown? and restrict citrina to Brazil. I am not aware on what
ground this view is based and in the absence of Brazilian specimens of
citrina and a larger number of specimens from Guiana I am unable to con-
firm or disprove it.

Char. subsp.— Larger and with a longer, heavier bill than any known race of the
species; male paler, particularly on the underparts, which have a whitish cast, than
the male of P. u. unicolor, which is nearly the same color below as above; female with
the auricular region usually grayish or tinted with buffy instead of dark olive-buff as
in P. u. geospizopsis; not certainly distinguishable in color from the much smaller
P. u, nivarius (Bangs).

Inhabits the Paramo zone of the Central Andes of Colombia southward
at least to Chimborazo, Ecuador.

throat, in the female.

of nine topotypical specimens of this currently unrecognized race, from the

region and throat markedly buffy-olive, a character which appears to dis-

specimens, though it is shown by some from Chimborazo. Should it prove
to be individual or seasonal this form would differ from other northern
forms of this group by its size alone.

We secured no specimens on the eastern slope of the Eastern Andes, and
I am therefore unable to say how birds from that region agree with A. a.
spectabilis from eastern Ecuador. Five specimens from the Magdalena
Valley and one from the lower Cauca, however, evidently represent the bird
currently known as erythrorhynchus. The Puerto Valdivia bird is the
darkest of the four and consequently approaches A. a. occidentalis. In this
race the chin is either wholly without or with but a trace of black.

I have but one specimen from Zamora. It is matched by others from
Zaruma and Duran, Prov. Guayas; while specimens from Esmeraldas in the
humid coast region of northwestern Ecuador, and from southwestern Colom-
bia, are nearer columbiana. They are smaller than specimens from the
Bogota region, and in this respect agree with Dabeiba birds, and may have
the flanks a trifle more olivaceous and the underparts a shade deeper, but
above they match true columbianus exactly.

Cereba mexicana cauce Cuarm., Bull. A. M. N. H., XXXTII, 1914, p. 186 (Cali,

Char. subsp.— Similar to Cereba mexicana columbiana (Cab.) but slightly smaller,
the superciliaries mixed with grayish, sides of the throat, and sometimes its center,
finely barred with grayish. Five males: Wing, 56.5; tail, 33.5; five females, wing,
53; tail, 32 mm.

This unexpected, but apparently quite distinct form is based on eleven
adults from the Cauca Valley and adjoining slopes of the Western and Cen-
tral Andes. The unusual characters in adults of this group, of a grayish
superciliary line and barred sides of the throat, are present in all our speci-
mens. At first glance these markings suggest immaturity, but the birds
showing them are unquestionably fully adult.

of eight males from Colombia and two from Merida, Venezuela, with two
from Aplobamba, Bolivia, which may be considered as typical of true sit-
toides, supports the characters attributed by Lafresnaye to the ‘Bogoté’
bird. The northern form is smaller with an actually stouter bill, and has
the sides and front of the head noticeably darker, the underparts of a more
cinnamon less ochraceous shade than in the Bolivian race. Specimens from
‘ Ambato’ and ‘Quito,’ Ecuador, resemble the Bolivian form in color but are
nearer the Colombian in size.

Known only from the Temperate Zone of the Western Andes. Since
its discovery by Richardson and Miller on the Andes west of Popayan,
Miller and Boyle secured a beautifully prepared series of this interesting
species at the northern end of the same range. Though quite distinct this
form is obviously a representative of D. gloriosa of the Venezuelan Andes.

I lave no specimens from Peru but four adult males and three females
from the eastern base of the Eastern Andes cannot, in my opinion, be sepa-
rated from British Guiana birds of which we have a large series. The black
throat-patch may average greener but the difference is too slight and incon-
stant to be of diagnostic value. Females from both localities are indistin-
guishable.

Dacnis cayana cerebicolor Hptim., P. Z. S., 1911, p. 1095 (Noanam4; Névita;
Tad6; Sipi; Jimenez; R. Oscuro).

This race like many other Tropical Zone birds, occupies the Pacific coast
region southward into Ecuador and north and east through Antioquia to the
hunid forested area of the lower central Magdalena. As Hellmayr (I. c.)
has pointed out Pacific coast specimens are not all typical, most of them
averaging paler, an exception, therefore, to the rule that when Pacific coast
and Magdalena representatives of a species differ in color those from the
former region are darker.

None of our eight males from the Pacific coast is as dark (7. e. purple)
as the most deeply colored of our Magdalena Valley birds. Some, however,
of the birds in both series are alike, while the palest of the Pacific coast birds
are not distinguishable in color from D. cayana napea, a form standing
between cerebicolor and ultramarina in color.

Specimens from eastern Panama (Chepigana). are typical of ultramarina,
but I agree with Hellmayr that the facts at hand warrant the treatment of
all these forms as subspecies of cayana.

averaging longer, blue of the male less purple, particularly on the rump, the females

Specimens from the Pacific coast region agree with others from Ecuador
and are clearly to be referred to this form, which, however, very closely
resemble true spiza. From lower Orinoco, Trinidad, and Cayenne birds,
the west Colombian and west Ecuadorian specimens differ mainly in being
slightly smaller with smaller bills. The Ecuadorian bird averages slightly
greener, but the difference is wholly overlapped by individual variation.
The Central American form, C. s. guatemalensis is decidedly greener than
exsul or spiza, but has the bill as large as in exsul while the wing (in specimens
from Costa Rica, Chiriqui and Panama) is little if any longer than in C. s.
exsul, .

It is interesting to observe that a specimen from Cocal (ait. 4000 ft.)

A wide-ranging but apparently not common species. Males from the
west slope of the Western Andes agree with others from the eastern slope

of three Ecuador males (labeled “Quito’’) has the yellow areas decidedly
paler than in Colombian specimens and evidently represents pelzelni Scl.,
but,a second ‘ Quito ’ specimen and one from Valle de Cumbaza, Mt. Chim-
borago, are very close to Venezuela specimens. A specimen from La Sierra,
south of Popayan resembles these two Ecuador specimens and if pelzelni be a
valid form should possibly be referred to it.

Inhabits the Tropical and Subtropical Zones from the Pacific Coast east

Specimens from the Pacific coast region are typical of this form and differ
from 7. x. brevirostris in the paler color of the yellow areas, particularly of
the crown. In size, however, birds from approximately the same altitudes
agree. Thus specimens from San José and Barbacoas are of about the same
size as those from La Morelia; again, San Antonio or Miraflores specimens,
while resembling chocoensis in color are as large as specimens of brevirostris
from La Palma and La Candela. Apparently, therefore, with both forms
there is a corresponding increase in size with increase in altitude.

This richly colored form is found in the Subtropical Zone of the western
slope of the Central Range, and in both Tropical and Subtropical Zones of
the Eastern Andes. As with the west Colombian form, specimens from the
lower altitudes average smaller. Thus three males from La Morelia (alt.
600 ft.) average wing, 61.5 mm., while three males from La Candela (alt.
6500 ft.), and La Palma (alt. 5500 ft.) average wing, 66mm. There appears
to be no difference in color between birds from mountains and lowlands.
Although specimens from the higher altitudes are as large as the largest
‘Quito’ birds, none shows any approach toward the purple-backed form from
that region (1. x. quitensis Nels.) and none have the crown as pale as Quito
specimens in which the back is as blue as in quitensis.

Char. subsp.— Similar to 7. a. aurulenta but underparts more richly colored,
approaching raw-sienna rather than analine-yellow, under tail-coverts, particularly,
deeper; the crown and rump slightly more intense, the margins to the feathers of
the back and, especially secondaries and wing-coverts, similar to color of head, and,
in adult specimens, without the tinge of green present in aurulenta; the bill averaging
longer.

Common in the Subtropical Zone of the Western Andes, but apparently
less numerous in the Central Andes. Specimens from Ricaurte in extreme
southern Colombia closely approach the Ecuadorian form, T. a. goodsont,
which is an intermediate between occidentalis and true aurulenta of the
Eastern Andes.

Doubtless they represent a separable form, but without examination of

Mr. Hellmayr has called attention to the apparent hiatus in the range of
this form, no examples of which appear to have been taken between those
here recorded and Panama, whence we have a McLeannan specimen without
exact locality. He suggests that gyroloides “is most probably confined to the
high open country of the interior,” and that bangsi will be found in the
Colombian coast district. Hellmayr, however, records true gyroloides from
the Tropical Zone on the Pacific coast (Jimenez, 1600 ft.) and-the case, in
my opinion, simply adds another species to the list of those occurring in
southwestern Colombia, Ecuador and Panama, but which are unknown on
the Colombian coast north of the Patia River.

and it appears to have crossed the comparatively low (7000 ft.) Andalucia
Pass, and thus entered the upper Magdalena Valley region. Birds from
near San Agustin have the rump and wing-coverts quite as brassy gold as
in specimens from southeastern Ecuador and can readily be distinguished
from West Andean specimens, and, as a rule, from those taken near Fusuga-
sugé. A specimen, however, from the Central Andes, west of Honda,
appears to be referable to ceruleocephala indicating the northward extension
of this form along the eastern slope of this range from Candela and La Palma.

Inhabits the Subtropical Zone of the Western Andes, western slope of the
Central Andes, and, from the latitude of Fusugasugé northward, the eastern
slope of the Central Andes and western slope of the Eastern Andes. Speci-
mens from the Western Andes have the rump and wing-coverts bluer than
those from the western slope of the Eastern Andes and thus approach cyano-
pygia of western Ecuador. Birds from the type-locality (Bucaramanga
and west Bogoté region) are nearer the golden-rumped form ceruleocephala.
This fact in connection with the distribution in Colombia of this and the
preceding race, indicates that granadensis was derived from the westward
whence it has ranged eastward around the northern end of the Western and
Central Andes to the western slope of the Eastern Andes, while ceruleo-
cephala, as above remarked, has entered the upper Magdalena Valley region
over the comparatively low Andalucia pass (alt. 7000 ft.).

this range true palpebrosa occurs. A single specimen from the Rio Toché
agrees with these West Andean specimens rather than with our series from

(4262) Compsocoma somptuosa victorini (Lajr.).
Tachyphonus victorint Larr., Rev. Zool., 1842, p. 336 (Bogoté).

_ This species inhabits the Subtropical Zone of the mountains rising from
the Magdalena Valley that is, the western slope of the Eastern Andes, and
the eastern slope of the Central Andes. The more southern examples
average darker above and have the margins of the wings a shade deeper blue.
‘They thus show an approach toward C. s. antioquie and their probable
intergradation with that form on the eastern slopes of the Central Andes
between La Candela and El Eden is indicated by specimens from the latter
locality in which the back is largely dark green and the margins of wings
and tail nearer in color to victorini than to true somptuosa.

Inhabits the Subtropical Zone of both the Western and Central Andes
in Antioquia and extends southward along the eastern slope of the Central
Andes. A specimen from the Paramillo in the Western Andes agrees with a
series from Sta. Elena (doubtless the type-locality or near it) the interscapu-
lum being tinged with green, the margins of wings and tail lighter than in
eyanoptera. Specimens from El Eden and Rio Toché as stated above, show
an approach toward victorini, with which it is believed they intergrade.

northern representative C. s. antioquie in the more northern parts of the
Central Andes and, as said above, indicates the probable mergence of that
form with the strongly differentiated C. s. victorint on the eastern slope of the
Central Andes.

Specimens from La Sierra, near Almaguer, in that part of southern
Colombia where the Andes form one complicated range, agree with Quito
specimens and are thus typical of eyanoptera in which the back is black, the
rump slightly and rarely not at all tinged with green, the margins to wings
and tail but little lighter than the color of the shoulder. This form persists
on the Western Andes (Cerro Munchique, La Florida, Gallera, Cocal, San
Antonio) but on the western slope of the Central Andes an approach toward
antioquie is evident in specimens from Miraflores, which while. having the
wings and tail-margins little if any lighter, have decidedly more green in the
back, this color encroaching on the interscapulum, a feature which in addi-
tion to the paler blue wing and tail-markings characterizes antioguie. The
intergradation of cyanoptera with antioquie is shown by these specimens.

In three specimens from Rio Toché and El Eden, on the eastern slope of
the range, the green in the back is still more extensive than in antioquie
reaching to the nape and they are therefore intermediate between antioquie
and victorint. The Subtropical Zone doubtless extends along the eastern
slope of the Central Andes continuously from El Eden to La Candela, where
we have taken dark colored specimens of victorini, connecting the ranges
of these birds and doubtless the birds themselves.

This case is interesting, for while victorint and somptuosa are obviously
representative forms, it has not heretofore been suspected, I believe, that
they intergrade, and the virtual proof -of this fact indicates the import-
ance of intensive collecting in a limited area. —

the Western Andes west of Popayan, two at El Pifion (alt. 9600 ft.) and one.
at Fusugasugé (alt. 6000 ft.) in the Western Andes.

Confined chiefly to the Temperate Zone and doubtless occurring in all

This species has an exceptionally wide range in Colombia occurring in
every fauna of the Tropical Zone from the Pacific coast to the eastern plains
though it has not been taken in the Cauca Valley. As Hellmayr has said
in Pacific coast specimens the head averages slightly duller, but they can be
exactly matched by others from farther east. This constancy of color in
birds from regions so widely separated and so different in chmatic conditions,
renders all the more surprising the fact that in western Ecuador a distinct
form (7. p. violarvata Berl.) of this bird should be found.

An abundant Tropical Zone bird which has ascended the Atrato Valley
to Quibdé, the Cauca Valley at least as far as Cali, and from this point has
doubtless reached the arid pocket on the western slope of the Western Andes
at Caldas. In the Magdalena Valley it is found to the very head of the
valley at San Agustin where the semi-arid Tropical Zone reaches an altitude
of 5000 feet. Our series of seventy specimens includes essentially topotypical
examples from the lower Magdalena, with which the other birds in the series
practically agree; though specimens from the upper Magdalena Valley are
slightly larger and have the throat and interscapular region somewhat darker.

Specimens from La Chorrera, western Panama, have slightly longer
tails but agree minutely in color with Colombian birds.

headed female to the black male. The latter plumage appears not to have
been described. It is dull, velvety black without trace of white anywhere
except on the under wing-coverts, which are white terminally margined
with black, and inner margins of the wing-quills.

In view of the strikingly different plumage of the female which has been
believed to be that of the male (though Cassin recorded his two Turbo
specimens as females) and the comparative rarity of males in transition
plumage, it is perhaps not surprising that the male of this species has es-
caped recognition as such; but it would not be surprising to discover that
it has been described under a different name, though I have been unable
to find one.

Lawrence’s type of virgatus, loaned me by Dr. Stone, has the white
stripes on the crown and below wider than in the figure of Sclater’s type (Cat.
Bds. B. M., XV, pl. xii) and two specimens from the Magdalena River.
We have, however, an essentially topotypical specimen of virgatus from
the Atrato River which closely agrees with Magdalena Valley specimens,
and we have also a specimen from the Magdalena Valley which in the
width of the stripes agrees with others from eastern Panama. It is my
belief therefore that but one race of this bird is représented by our series, and
for that race, as stated above, I consider that Sclater’s name has priority.
In addition to the specimens listed below we have also twelve males and
three females from eastern Panama (El Real, Tapaliza, etc.).

A pair from Barrigon, east of Villavicencio, agrees with a British Guiana

the bill considerably smaller, the average being 17.5 mm. as compared
with 19.5 mm. in specimens from the Magdalena Valley and Pacific coast.

Thamnophilus nevius atrinucha Hetim., P. Z. 8., 1911, p. 1158 (San Joaquim;

Common throughout the greater part of the ‘Tropical Zone but not
taken by us in the Cauca Valley. Specimens from the Pacific coast region
are typical; those from La Frijolera show a slight approach toward the
Magdalena Valley form which agrees with true afrinucha in size, but has
the underparts in the male paler than in either atrinucha or punctata. The
upperparts average less black than in atrinucha, while the female is inter-
mediate in color; those from the central Magdalena (Honda, etc.) being
nearer atrinucha, while two from the Santa Marta region approach punc-
tata in their more rufescent back and more rufous cap. A third Santa
Marta female agrees with atrinucha.

It is probable that on the basis of the characters shown by the male
which, it will be. observed is paler below than either of the races it stands
between, the Magdalena Valley bird is separable, but I do not consider it
advisable to name it without a more thorough examination of the entire
group than my material permits of. This is doubtless the form which
Hellmayr (Abh. Bayer. Akad. Wiss., XXII, 1906, p. 659) provisionally
tefers to albiventris Tacz. of north Peru. It does not seem probable, how-
ever, that birds from the Magdalena Valley and Peru are identical, while
the form occupying the east Bogoté region, as shown above, is referable
to punctata.

Thamnophilus tenuepuntatus (sic) Larr., Rev. Zool., 1853, p. 339 (“Anolaima,’”’

I refer to this species three males and two females ftom Villavicencio.
The females have the throat striped, the rest of the underparts distinctly
barred with black and white, the black bars being somewhat narrower,
the white bars wider than in the male. The upperparts are rufous-chest-
nut unmarked except for a slight extension of the markings of the side of
the neck on to the nape. They thus resemble the females of multistriatus
but are more heavily barred with black below.

Thamnophilus tenuifasciatus Lawr. (Ann. N. Y. Lye., VIII, 1867, p.

mized by Sclater (Cat. Bds. B. M. XV, p. 211) with 7. multistriatus. It
has, however, the cap black, unmarked, and is apparently a representative
of T. tenuipunctatus, from which it differs in being larger (o", wing, 75
mm. as compared with 70 mm. in tenuipunctatus) and in having the black
bars wider and the white ones above less broken, the bands on the tail more
complete. I have no specimens of T. berlepschi Tacz. of Peru, which
appears to differ substantially from tenuifasciatus (cf. Tacz.Orn. du Perou,

darker, the crown between russet and argus-brown instead of cinnamon-brown,
and more distinctly defined from the back, the back with a russet tinge, the tail
hazel rather than cinnamon-rufous.

This form, of which we have now two specimens, is clearly an inter-
mediate between T. equatorialis of eastern Ecuador and southeastern
Colombia, and the quite different T. anabatinus group of Panama to
Mexico. Being forms of the Tropical Zone the ranges of equatorialis and
intermedius are apparently separated by the Andean system, but the near
relationships of @quatorialis and anabatinus are indicated by the discovery
of this Colombian race. The specimen from Alto Bonito agrees with the
type.

Agustin; Andalucia; Buena Vista).

Mr. W. E. Clyde Todd (J. c.) has presented us with such a careful study of
the relationships of the puzzling assemblage of birds forming the Dysithamnus
mentalis group, that I hesitate to advance conclusions differing somewhat

. from those reached by him after an examination of our specimens.

Whether we have one or more species in this group, I am not prepared
to say, and so far as specific relationships are concerned, the names here
adopted must be considered as tentative. Far more material than is now
available is required before this exceptionally difficult problem can be
solved. Meanwhile, I merely attempt to identify our Colombian material,
using my knowledge of the faunal affinities of certain localities when the
specimens from them cannot be satisfactorily referred to one form or another.

The specimens I should refer to the present race (the characters of which
have been fully described by Mr. Todd) are all from the Subtropical Zone
of the Eastern Andes, and eastern slope of the Central Andes. Seven
specimens from Miraflores (= e. of Palmira) and two from La Frijolera,
both on the western slope of the Central Andes, referred by Mr. Todd to
this race, I place respectively under D. s. extremus, and an as yet. unnamed
race of D. mentalis; while a series from the Pacific coast of Ecuador, consid-
ered by the same author to be semicinereus, I believe to represent a third
race distinguished by its smaller size, slight color differences in the adult
male and pronounced color differences in the female and immature male.

Dysithamnus semicinereus Sci. & Sarv., P. Z. 8., 1879,-p. 525 (Concordia).

Inhabits the Subtropical Zone of the Western Andes and western slope
of the Central Andes, descending to the upperpart of the Tropical Zone on
the western slope of the Western Andes and in the Cauca Valley.

While adult males of this race can readily be distinguished from semi-
cinereus, immature males of the two forms, as Mr. Todd (J. ¢.; p. 551) has
remarked, are “not distinguishable in any way... .”
1917.] Chapman, Distribution of Bird-life in Colombia. 371

In view of this fact, it does not seem to me to be desirable to follow Mr.
. Todd in referring immature males from east of Palmira (Miraflores) on the
western slopes of the Central Andes to semicinereus. Study of our Colom-
bian material shows that when a certain species is represented by different
forms in the Eastern Andes and Western Andes, specimens from the western,
or Cauca Valley slope of the Central Andes agree, as indeed might be
expected, with the form from the Western Andes, while those from the east-
ern, or Magdalena Valley slope of the Central Andes agree with the East
Andean form. Indeed, a specimen from Salento, a locality on the western
slope of the Central Andes which has essentially the same avifauna as
Miraflores, is typical of extremus. Either, therefore, we have to treat ex-
tremus as a full species which occurs in the same fauna as semicinereus, or as
a representative, intergrading form. The specimens at hand unfortunately
do not afford conclusive evidence of the status of the West Andean bird, but
all things considered, it seems to me more probable that the Miraflores speci-
mens are immature examples of extremus rather than adults of semicinereus.

Dysithamnus mentalis lateralis Topp, Bull. A. M. N. H., XX XV, 1916, p. 541
(Honda specimens only).

A fully adult male and a female from La Frijolera, in Antioquia on the
lower Cauca River, and two females from E] Consuelo, above Honda, belong,
in my opinion, to the same form, The male has the back olive-green clearly
defined from the plumbeous of the nape and head, and the yellow of the
abdomen extends well up to the breast. It therefore closely resefnbles
specimens of mentalis recently taken by us in the Organ Mountains, west
of Rio Janeiro.

The female has the underparts much clearer and stronger yellow than
any bird in a.series of some twenty specimens of semicinereus and extremus,
and in this respect agrees essentially with two females of D. mentalis latera-
lis Todd, from northeastern Venezuela.

The two females from El Consuelo, near Honda, have been referred by
Mr. Todd to his D. m. lateralis, but there can be no doubt that they belong
to the same form as the birds from La Frijolera. This, as the male from
that locality shows, is not lateralis, but is nearer true mentalis. In my
opinion, these four birds represent an as yet unnamed race, which occupies
the lower Cauca-Magdalena humid fauna. I should, however, prefer to

‘see more material before committing myself definitely on this subject, but
I feel that when the range and relationships in Colombia of the forms.

Fauna which ranges downward to the upperpart of the Tropical Zone.

Known from the arid coastal zone at Cartagena and eastward to the

Assuming that our large series (18 males, 29 females) from near Santa
Marta represented intermedia, I described the Upper Magdalena Valley
bird as new on the basis of the striking difference between the females from
these regions, those from Santa Marta having the breast conspicuously
streaked with black, while the upper Magdalena female has the underparts
whitish more or less washed with buffy and wholly without spots.

Now, however, Miller and Boyle send four females and a male from La
Playa, near the mouth of the Magdalena, which are inseparable from the
Upper Magdalena birds to which I have applied the name honde; that is,
the females are unspotted below, and the male has the tail more narrowly
tipped with white than in the Santa Marta and Venezuela male. I still

lack topotypes of intermedia, but there is small probability of there being
any difference between La Playa and Cartagena birds. In any event, it
is far from likely that specimens from Cartagena would resemble those from
Santa Marta rather than those from the intervening locality of La Playa.

It is true that Cabanis describes the female of intermedia as having the
breast spotted, but since he had a specimen or specimens from Venezuela
as well as Cartagena it is possible he may have described a female from
Venezuela under the belief that it belonged to the same species as that
found at Cartagena. However this may be, his name is applicable only
to the Cartagena form, which in view of our recently acquired specimens
from La Playa, I believe to belong to the species in which the female has
no spots on the breast. It therefore most nearly resembles true grisea of
the Guianas in which the female is more washed with ochraceous-rufous
below than in intermedia, but, like the latter, is without spots on the un-
derparts.

Apparently these two forms are entirely cut off from each other by
others in which the female is conspicuously spotted below. The Orinoco
form is orenocensis of Helimayr, and seems to be specifically distinct. The
form occupying the Caribbean coast region from Santa Marta to north-
eastern Venezuela, to which the name intermedia has been commonly ap-
plied, should apparently bear the name of cano-fumosa Cherrie. J have
not seen Cherrie’s type, but in describing cano-fumosa (Bull. Bklyn. Inst.
Arts & Sciences, 1909, p. 388) from Las Barrancas on the lower Orinoco,
this author remarks: “Specimens in the American Museum collection from
Santa Marta, Colombia, San Antonio and Cumanacoa, Bermudez, Vene-
zuela, all seem to belong to this form.” Hellmayr and Seilern (Archiv. |
fiir Naturg. 1912, p. 126) also share this view, though they fall into the
common error of using the name intermedia for the species in which the
female has the breast streaked.

The specimens in our museum, including thirty-four females of cano-
fumosa from Bonda, Santa Marta; Puerto Cabello, San Antonio, and
Cristobal Colon, Venezuela, and six males and six females of orenocensis
from Maripa on the Orinoco, lead me to believe that these forms are spe-
cifically distinct from each other and from grisea on the east and intermedia
on the west. The two latter, although most closely related of any in the
group, would therefore be separated by a wide area occupied with repre-
sentative but not intergrading races. The case is an exceptionally interest-
ing one and deserves a study which neither my time nor material will permit
me to give it.

Found by us in the Subtropical Zone of the Western and Central Andes.
We did not-secure it in the Bogota region. In the absence of topotypical
specimens I was led to believe, both by Sclater’s original description and
plate (J. c.), as well as by his description in the British Museum Catalogue
(XV, p. 253), in which it is said the “centre of the cap is black,” that true
caudata had the cap black and, consequently, that Santa Marta males,
in which the cap is black represented this form. Hence the birds from
western Colombia with a striped crown were described under the name
striaticeps (1. ¢.). .

Hellmayr, however, writes me that the type, as well as other Bogoté
specimens which he has examined, have the crown striped, and are not
separable from Ecuadorian specimens. It follows, therefore, that striat:-
ceps becomes a synonym of caudata, from which the black-crowned Santa
Marta bird is separable.!

said to have come, is, in a limited way, the ‘ Bogota’ of southern Colombia.
In other words, as the commercial center of that part of Colombia, it is the
shipping point for the products of the surrounding country. Consequently
the specimens recorded below from Barbacoas on the trail from the coast

lombian specimens to tyrannina. Cauca Valley specimens agree exactly
with those from the Bogoté region, but-males from southwestern Colombia
and western Ecuador average darker than true tyrannina but, on the whole,
are nearer to that form than to the blacker crepera. Females from Panama,
southwestern Colombia, and western Ecuador agree in the color of the
underparts and average deeper rufous than tyrannina but not so deep as
crepera. Above, however, they agree with the former rather than the
latter, crepera having the back and particularly tail, often with a rufescent
suffusion wanting in tyrannina.

This appears to be a very common bird in the humid Tropical Zone of
the Pacifie coast of Ecuador and Colombia from at least Naranjo, Prov.
Guayas, north to Bagado at the head of the Atrato. Further north, both
males and females are paler below and less rufescent above than Ecuador
specimens, and thus establish the validity of Myrmeciza maculifer cassini
(see also remarks under that race).

While Myrmelastes exsul, of the Canal Zone and northward, is obviously
the representative of maculifer, existing material (including a large series
from eastern Panama) indicates the non-intergradation of these birds, and
this view is supported by the fact that M. m. cassini, the most northern
form of maculifer is, in general coloration, further from exsul than is true
maculifer of Ecuador. Of the latter form I have twenty specimens (15 males,
5 females) from Ecuador.

Inhabits the Tropical Zone of the lower Atrato eastward through Antio-
quia to the Magdalena and northward to eastern Panama.

With a large series (sixty-six males, twenty-eight females) before me
I find no difficulty in separating birds from western Ecuador and south-
western Colombia (Barbacoas) from those from the northern end of the
range of this species (Puerto Valdivia and Rio Salaqui, Col., El Real and
Tapaliza, eastern Panama). The latter are decidedly paler; the male
has the back and flanks more olivaceous less intensely rufescent, the head
and underparts paler gray, the throat less blackish and usually clearly de-
marked from the gray breast. The differences in the female are similar
in character but are less pronounced.

Intergradation between these extremes is absolute and intermediate
specimens occur in so large a part of the intervening area, that it is wholly
impossible to assign definite geographic boundaries to the range of either
form. Specimens fairly topotypical of maciulifer and others which might
with equal truth be referred to cassini are found at the same locality, but,
on the whole, the former may be said to be the prevailing form as far north
as the upper Atrato, while beyond this cassint occurs.

Our eastern Panama specimens show no sign of intergradation with M.
exsul exsul of the Canal Zone and westward.

Found by us in the Tropical Zone of the Magdalena Valley, at Mira-

lower Cauca. Two females from the last-named locality are typical of
immaculatus while three males from Alto Bonito on the western slope of
the same range are referable to berlepschi. It may be distinguished from
the Pacific coast race (1.4. berlepscht) by the comparatively small amount
of white in the lesser wing-coverts of both sexes and by the duller, grayer
underparts of the females.

Comparison of fourteen males and eleven females from the Pacific
Tropical Zone of Colombia with four males and seven females from western
Ecuador (Rio d’Oro, Naranjo, Santa Rosa) shows that birds from western
Colombia and western Ecuador agree. From true tmmaculatus they may
be distinguished by the larger amount of white in the lesser coverts and by
the deeper, more richly colored underparts of the female. M. «. zeledoni of
Costa Rica, of which I have only a pair of adults, appears to agree with
immaculatus in the amount of white in the lesser coverts, but in the colora-
tion of the underparts of the female, it resembles berlepschi.

An evidently not common inhabitant of the Tropical Zone of the Pacific

vista, Narifio, female may be considered as topotypical, and two females
from San José essentially agree with it. A female from Puerto Valdivia
has the marks on the throat whiter and, with three males from the same
locality, the tail more rufous. These four birds thus approach specimens
from eastern Panama. J have, however, seen no authentic specimens of
lemosticta, and if the eastern Panama specimens should prove to repre-
sent an undescribed form, doubtless it would be desirable to refer the Puerto
Valdivia specimens to it rather than to nigricauda.

Inhabits the Tropical Zone of the Pacific coast .and eastward to the
Magdalena. Our Pacific coast specimens agree with others from Panama
which Hellmayr (J. c.) fixes as the type-locality, but a female from the
Magdalena Valley (Malena) is much paler below than any one of eight
females from Panama and western Colombia.

Found at one station in the Tropical Zone of the Pacific coast and also
on the lower Cauca. The Puerto Valdivia specimen agrees essentially
with the type and other Panama specimens. Those from Barbacoas have
a less well-defined, unspotted, chestnut-rufous area posterior to the breast.

A pair from the Amazonian Tropical Zone adds this species to the known
avifauna of Colombia. The male differs from two lower Orinoco (Suapure)
males in having the breast and abdomen centrally barred with black, the

‘female differs from a lower Orinoco female in having the hazel-brown throat
area more restricted and less definitely bordered by a black line. These
differences may be racial but the material at hand is not, in my opinion,
conclusive (see Cherrie, Bull. A. M. N. H., XXXV, 1916, p. 185). Rhopo-
terpe torquata tragicus Cherrie (J. c.) based on a female from the Rio Reosevelt
appears to differ from forguata chiefly in its wider and more extensive white

‘ wing-bar.

Four specimens were secured in the Tropical Zone of Amazonian Co-
lombia. Three have the forehead black while in the third (immature?)
it is rufous of the same color as the back. All four specimens may be easily
distinguished from’ any one of twelve specimens of colma from the lower

Orinoco (La Union), British Guiana and Cayenne by the greater inten-
sity and greater extent of the black of the underparts, and their much
darker ventral region and under tail-coverts. They also have the tail
broadly black terminally and raw umber basally, while in most specimens
of colma it is more olivaceous basally and more narrowly tipped with black.

The material.at my command, therefore, indicates the validity of a
black-bellied form for which the name nigrifrons Gould is probably available.

A female from San José is duller than the type of F. n. nigricapillus and
can be matched by several of our fourteen Ecuadorian specimens of des-
tructus. The occurrence of nigricapillus and a second form of this group —
(“ Formicarius umbrosus’”’ Ridgw.) in the same zone (Caribbean Tropical)
in Costa Rica indicates their specific distinctness. Ridgway (Bull. 50, V,
p. 118) evidently holds this view but ranks nigricapillus as a subspecies of
analis, while wmbrosus with allied forms is placed under F. moniliger as
Formicarius moniliger umbrosus. To my mind, however, the derivative re-
lationships of wmbrosus are with analis, while nigricapillus and destructus,

and western Ecuador, form a small and distinct group, distinguished mainly
by its jet black head, wholly black or. blackish, not basally olive-brown,
black-tipped, tail, ete. It is probable that both have a common origin but
one appears to have entered Central America from the east, the other from
the south. The discovery of a form (Formicarius analis connectens) at
the foot of the Eastern Andes in Colombia, to some extent bridges the gap
between the Bolivian analis and the northern saturaius. We have also a
specimen from Zamora in southeastern Ecuador which in the blackness of
its tail and breast approaches destructus; the head, however, is olivaceous
and the upperparts, while somewhat darker, are more as in connectens.
This specimen suggests the specific identity of the entire group, but the
impossibility of this Tropical Zone bird’s crossing the Andes and the. con-
sequent isolation of the black-headed type, together with the occurrence
of this type and another representative of the group in the same faunal
region, indicates their specific distinctness.

This appears to be’a species of the Tropical Zone. It was common in
the heavy forests at Buena Vista, but was not found at Villavicencio at
the base of the Andes, doubtless because of the lack of suitable haunts.
In the primeval forests about La Morelia (alt. 600 ft.), however, it was
represented by a form which I provisionally refer to C. b. nobilis.

The striking difference in the song of this species and that of C. turdina
has been well described by Fuertes (Bird-Lore, 1914, p. 180).

Three specimens from La Morelia appear to represent this form of
which, however, I have no specimens for comparison. They have the tail
tipped with white rather than with “pale fulvous” and may be separable,
but I hesitate to take this step without direct comparison with authentic
specimens of nobilis. :

Probably not uncommon in the upper part of the Subtropical Zone of
the Central and Eastern Andes, where the density of the vegetation and
the bird’s elusive habits make it exceedingly difficult to secure specimens.
We did not see or hear this species in the vicinity of Bogotd, but in the
Central Andes above Miraflores at an altitude of 8000 feet, its singular,
prolonged whistle was not infrequently heard and Fuertes secured one
specimen. Two others were taken by Miller, one at La Palma, the other
at Andalucia (alt. 7000 ft.) on the crest of the Eastern Andes. The latter
specimen being from the range from which the type was secured is probably
typical of the species. It agrees closely with the Miraflores bird, but the
La Palma specimen is more olivaceous above; probably an individual
variation.

From C. brevicauda this species is readily distinguished by the absence

p. 1175 (Rio Sipi, 150 ft., w. Col.).

Of this interesting bird, hitherto known only from the male type, we
have two adult males and one adult and one immature female, all from the
low Pacific coast region to which the species appears to be restricted. The
tales agree with Hellmayr’s (1. c.) description.

The adult female differs from the male mainly in having the broad,
black superciliary striped with white. The belly is more fulvous but this
feature appears to be individual rather than sexual! since it is not shown by
the immature female. In that specimen the superciliary is barely evident,
this part of the head being much like the crown which is dull chestnut
bordered with blackish. The tips to the coverts are ochraceous, of the
color of the throat; the belly has a slight ochraceous tinge but is by no
means so deeply colored as in the adult female. A few soft downy, black-
ish feathers of the juvenal plumage are on the flanks. The ingrowing
whitish feathers at the sides of the abdomen exhibit a faint but unmis-
takable trace of cross-bars, and this character is present but in an even
fainter degree on the remaining three specimens.

Description of Male—— (Four specimens). Crown and nape bright rufous-chest-
nut slightly paler laterally; lores and a broad superciliary extending to the nape
black; back light brownish olive, slightly browner than in P. rosenbergi, the feathers
widely margined with black; rump browner, unstriped; the feathers much elongated
and ‘fluffy’; tail raw umber; wing-quills black margined externally with Brussels-
brown, this color increasing in extent inwardly and occupying the entire outer web
of the inner secondaries and both webs of the tertials which have a rounded buffy
terminal shaft-spot, and a slightly blackish edging; primary coverts blackish, un-
marked; remaining wing-coverts of much the same brown as the exposed surface
of the wing, with conspicuous buffy whitish terminal spots occupying most of the
end of the feather which is narrowly margined with black; under wing-coverts black-
ish with some mixture of rusty, those at the base of the outer primaries broadly
tipped with white forming a conspicuous white patch; throat and sides of the head
deep, clear orange-rufous somewhat richer than in P. rosenbergi, the feathers without
any indication of spots as in P. rufopileatum, on three specimens, but with two basal
concealed lateral black spots on one feather in one specimen; rest of the underparts
of the same tone of color as the throat but less intense, especially medianly, the sides,
flanks and tibise brownish olive, the ventral region and under tail-coverts more buffy;
in one of four males the underparts from the posterior margin of the throat to, and
including the upper part of the tibie and under tail-coverts, but excluding the thighs
and flanks, are more or less regularly and evenly barred with black; in the remain-
ing three males the bars are wanting in some places, and faint or but merely suggested
by detached spots in others, no regularity being shown by their distribution except
on the ventral region and under tail-coverts where they are present much as in the
fully barred specimen; feet brownish black; maxilla black; mandible wholly black
in the barred specimen; gonys terminally horn-color in the three comparatively
unbarred specimens. .

Description of Female— (Two specimens). Resembling the male but the lores
blackish with a whitish supraloral stripe, the superciliary strongly streaked with
ochraceous-rufous, the spots on wing-coverts more ochraceous, the under wing-
coverts and white patch at base of primaries tinged with rufous; the throat as in
the male, the remainder of the underparts with but mere suggestions of broken bars
much as in the least barred male.

It is assuredly surprising to find two evidently representative but appar-
ently distinct species of birds at localities in the same fatina, as closely
situated as are the ranges of Pitiasoma rufopileatum and the bird described

as P. harterti. It should be remembered, however, that in this fauna,
though at more widely separated stations, we already have three species of
Pittasoma, namely, P. rufopileatum of northwestern Ecuador, P. rosenbergi
of the headwaters of the San Juan, and P. michleri of the lower Atrato and
eastern Panama. Ii is evident, therefore, that this genus, which is restricted
to the Colombian-Pacific Fauna, has a marked tendency to break up into
distinct species in an area where many other species do not show even sub-
specific variation. Possibly therefore, it is not much more remarkable to
find different though representative species of Pittasoma in northwestern
Eeuador and southwestern Colombia, than it is to find them in central
western Colombia and northwestern Colombia.

Of P. rufopileatum I have seen no specimens, but Hartert’s excellent
plate ‘ of this species forms an admirable substitute for skins. It should be
added, however, that Hellmayr (P. Z. S., 1911, p. 1176) has shown that the
bird figured by Hartert as young, is an adult female. Hellmayr remarks:
“This is quite evident from the large series, partly in the Tring Museum,
partly in the possession of Mr. Rosenberg, which I have examined.”

I take pleasure in naming this bird for Dr. Ernest Hartert, in recognition
of his important contributions to ornithology, and particularly to our knowl-
edge of the ornis of the Pacific coast region.

Remarks.— This form known only from the type, is a diminutive of
Grallaria guatimalensis from which it is possibly specifically distinct. Gral-
laria regulus Scl. of Ecuador, resembles guatimalensis above but is much
paler below and its white throat-patch and strongly white or buff-streaked
olivaceous breast, more olive wings, etc. show that it is quite a different
species, which the form here described does not approach.

other birds in our series which, as a whole, is uniformly colored and shows

We have found this to be the commonest and most widely distributed

low as 4500 feet and rarely reaches upward to the lower border of the
Temperate Zone. It frequents rather more open, scrubby and arid places
than the other birds of the group, and its loud, double-noted whistle, trans-
lated by the natives as “compra pan”’ is one of the most characteristic bird
calls. There is considerable variation in the intensity of color above, and

Evidently occupies the lower Atrato region and eastward into Antio-
quia. In its generally paler colors, a specimen from the Rio Salaqui agrees’
with Panama specimens rather than with periopthalmica. A Puerto Val-
divia male has the fulvous markings still paler while its olive-green back
is more like that of G. p. lizanozt than of true perspicillata.

Grallaricula costaricensis Lawr., Ann. Lyc. N. H., N. Y., VIII, 1867, p. 346 (Bar-
ranca, Costa Rica). .

A male from Cocal and a female from San Antonio are more extensively
washed with ochraceous below than five of six specimens of costaricensis.
The male has the entire underparts ochraceous; the female has the abdomi-
nal region white; above they agree in color with costaricensis but they
are somewhat larger. Doubtless the west Colombian bird will be found
to be separable but this species is so variable in color that I should prefer
to see a much larger series before adding to the number of described races.
Grallaricula vegeta Bangs, the type of which I have examined, appears to
me to be inseparable from costaricensis.

Grallaricula flavirostris brevis Nels., of which I have seen the type and
three topotypes, has the back more olivaceous, the crown grayer than in
costaricensis. This form may be confined to the Subtropical Zone of Mt.
Pirri. In the absence of authentic specimens of flavirostris I cannot com-
ment on its relationships to that race, but it is apparent that all the speci-
mens examined from Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia, represent but
one species. Two specimens from Zaruma, Ecuador, which may be flavi-
rostris, are more yellow below than costaricensis and have the maxilla as
well as mandible yellow.

Upucerthia excelsior columbiana Cuarm., Bull. A. M. N. H., XXXI, 1912, p. 148
(Paramo of Santa Isabel, Cen. Andes, Col.).

Char. subsp.— Similar to Upucerthia excelsior excelsior Scl., but bill stouter and
longer, superciliary and light areas of underparts whiter, brownish areas below hair-
brown rather than broccoli-brown.

Found by us only in the Paramo of Santa Isabel in the Central Andes
where Allen and Miller secured twenty specimens. In the British Museum
Catalogue (XV, p. 19) Sclater lists specimen “a. 9 ad. SK. Pichincha,
Ecuador (Fraser)”’ and specimen “b 9 ad. SK. Panza [Chimborazo], Ecua-
dor, (Fraser)” as types of Upucerthia excelsior. Accepting the locality
first-named as the type-locality I made my original comparison with Mt.
Pichincha specimens. I find, however, that in the original description
(P. Z. 5., 1860, p. 77}, Sclater made no mention of Pichincha but gave as
the habitat of the species: “In Monte Chimborazo, reipubl. Equator, ad.
alt. 14,000 ped.” It follows, therefore, that Chimborazo, not Pichincha, as
stated by me, is the type-locality of the species. Fortunately we have
since received an excellent series of fourteen specimens collected by Richard-
son on Chimborazo which confirm the characters ascribed to the Colombian
bird. .

An adult male from Miraflores in the Central Andes agrees with an adult
female from Buena Vista, above Villavicencio, and is evidently to be re-
ferred to this species. A young female from Miraflores has the spots on
the underparts fewer and less distinct.

Lochmias obscurata Cab., to which I refer two specimens from Inca
Mines, Peru, is much darker, less rufous above and below, and has fewer,
less evident spots on the underparts, those which are present being con-
fined largely to the median line.

Synallazis azare elegantior Cuarm., Bull. A. M. N. H., XX XIII, 1914, p. 618

Inhabits the Temperate Zone of the Eastern Andes. In view of the
occurrence of S. a. media at Quito, it might be expected that specimens
from south of Quito would be intermediate between media and azare, but
the distributional problem is much involved by the fact that seven speci-
mens from Zaruma (6000 ft.), one from Loja (7000 ft.), and one from Na-

- ranjo (2000 ft.) in southern Ecuador, are all clearly referable to elegantior
of Bogota! It is sufficiently surprising to find in this group identical forms
occupying the Temperate Zone in the Bogoté region and the Tropic Zone
near Guayaquil, but the case is rendered still more puzzling by the occur-
rence between these points of another form with which, at least frem the
north, intergradation. with the first-named form appears to be proven.

and are slightly grayer below and less intensely olivaceous above. They
are, however, nearer to true nigrifumosa in the color of the parts named

Synallaxis gularis rufipectus CuHapm., Bull. A. M. N. H., XXXI, 1912, p. 149
(Laguneta, Cen. Andes, Col.).

Inhabits the Temperate Zone. in all three ranges. A male collected at
El Pifion just south of Bogoté, is much less rufescent above and more ru-
fescent below than two ‘Bogot&’ skins in the Museum collection. The
latter are bright amber-brown above with the jugulum and center of the
breast grayish, while the El Pifion specimen is uniform ochraceous-buff
below. It thus more nearly resembles 8. g. rufipectus in general color than
it does the Bogoté specimens which I assume represent true gularis. One
of the latter has indeed been compared with Lafresnaye’s type which it
resembles but has the breast somewhat paler. Not one of eight specimens
from the Western and Central Andes in Colombia and three from near
Quito are so bright as these two ‘Bogot&’ specimens, but the occurrence at
El Pifion, in the heart of the Bogoté region, of a specimen which is essen-
tially like those of the Western Andes indicates either that two forms occur
in the Eastern Andes or that the two Bogoté skins are not normally colored
and have perhaps undergone some change in color since collected. I in-
cline to the latter rather than the former theory and therefore enter my
Synallazis gularis rufipectus as a synonym of S. g. gularis.

Accepting Wied’s “ Anabates leucopthalmus”’ as the type of Automolus
it is clear that the present species is not properly referable to that genus.
Its affinities appear rather to be with Thripadectes. As in similar cases,
where generic separation should, in my opinion, be based only on a study
of all the species concerned, I follow Brabourne and Chubb’s list.

Found by us only in the Tropical Zone at the eastern base of the Eastern
Andes. Hellmayr (Nov. Zool., XIV, 1907, p. 365) refers Bogota birds to
the form here given. I have no material for comparison.

(2445) Automolus dorsalis Sci. & Salo.

Automolus dorsalis Sci. & Sauv., P. Z. S., 1880, p. 158 (Sarayacu, Ecuador).

Two specimens from La Morelia and one from Florencia agree with two
from Zamora near the type-locality. A third Zamora specimen has the
410 Bulletin American Museum of Natural Hsitory. (Vol. XXXVI,

superciliaries and nuchal region ochraceous and the underparts are washed
with this color. It agrees more nearly with the description of the type but
is evidently immature.

Automolus pallidigularis Lawn., Ann. Lyc. N. H. N. Y., VIL, 1862, p. 465 (Lion
Hill, Panama); Scu. & Saty., P. Z.S., 1879, p. 522 (Remedios).

Inhabits the Tropical Zone in Antioquia and the Magdalena Valley.
It has been recorded from northwestern Ecuador (Hart., Nov. Zool., 1901,
pp. 369, 241) as A. p. albidior, an apparently invalid form, but is unknown
from the Pacific coast of Colombia. ‘

Our specimens, particularly those from Malena and Honda, are less
rufous above, less ochraceous below, and have the throat whiter than the
type, but differ little from east Panama (Tacarcuna) specimens.

(2447) Automolus infuscatus infuscatus (Scl.).

Anabaies infuscatus Scu., Ann. & Mag. N. H. (2), XVII, 1856, p. 468 (eastern
Peru).

Three specimens from La Morelia and two from Florencia differ from
two specimens of A. cervicalis (Scl.) from La Union, Caura River, Venezuela
(= Aufomolus sclateri in part of authors; see Hellm., Nov. Zool. XITI,
1906, p. 335), having the upperparts more olivaceous. I have no Peruvian
specimens for comparison.

(2450) Automolus nigricauda saturatus Chapm.

Automolus nigricauda saturatus CaarM., Bull. A. M. N. H., XXXIV, 1915, p. 644
(Alto Bonito, Antioquia, Col.).

Char. subsp.— Similar to A. n. nigricauda Hart. but very much darker; the back
deep blackish bay instead of between raw-umber and mummy-brown, the crown
and nape only slightly darker than the back, with more of a claret-brown tinge,
which is clearer on the sides of the head; wings externally of the same color as the
back, tail black; breast somewhat. deeper than in nigricauda the rest of the under-
parts darker brown, less olivaceous, the sides and particularly flanks much darker,
nearly the color of the back. :

Inhabits the Tropical Zone in the lower Atrato Valley and northward
to eastern Panama.

(2454) Automolus cinnamomeigula Hellm.

Automolus cinnamomeigula Hetio., Bull. B. O. C., XV, 1905, p. 55 (‘Bogoté’ —
I propose La Morelia, alt. 600 ft., Rio Bodaquera, Caquetd, Col.).

This species appears to be the Amazonian representative of A. n. nigri-
cauda Hart., from which, however, it differs materially in its rufous tail,

browner upperparts, more ochraceous belly, etc. I have not seen the
type in the Museum at Tring.
Two females and a male from La Morelia.

vicencio).
Philydor rufipileatus consobrinus Hp.tim., Verh. Ges. Wien., 1908, p. 220.

Found only in the Tropical Zone at the eastern base of the Eastern Andes.

I have no specimens of true rufipileatus and follow Hellmayr (I. ¢.) in
the arrangement of names given above.

(2464) Philydor pyrrhodes (Cab.).
Anabates pyrrhodes Cas., in Schomb. Reise Guiana, 1848, p. 689 (British Guiana).

A specimen from La Morelia adds this species to the known fauna of

Colombia. It agrees essentially with specimens from Napo and the foot
of Mt. Duida. “

(2468) Philydor ruficaudatus (d’Orb. & Lafr.) subsp.

Anabates ruficaudatus p’Ors. & Larr., Syn. Av., II, 1838, p. 15 (Yuracares
Bolivia). ,

Two specimens from La Morelia, evidently represent this species and
are doubtless separable from it, but my material is not sufficiently satis-
factory to warrant this step. They are decidedly darker, less olive above
than a specimen from near the junction of the Gy-Parana and Madeira
rivers, and less buffy below than three specimens from Zaruma, Ecuador,
which I assume are Philydor subfulous Sel. These Zaruma birds, however,
seern to be only subspecifically distinct from ruficaudatus, nevertheless

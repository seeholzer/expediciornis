Char. subsp — Resembling C. c. caligatus (Gould) of Central America in the
vermiculation of the wings and feathering of the tarsus, but with the head blue or
purplish as in C. violaceus (= meridionalis) and C. ramonianus; size, particularly
-of bill, smaller than in allies. Wing, 106; tail, 116; bill from nostril, 10mm.

A Tropical Zone species known only from the humid Cauca-Magdalena
‘region and northward to Santa Marta.

Ii will be observed that this form to some extent bridges the gap between
caligatus and violaceus and,in spite of the differences in the feathering of their
tarsi, it seems not improbable that these two forms will be found to inter-
grade. There is less difference in size between specimens from Nicaragua
and Ecuador, than there is between those from the Caribbean Coast of
Colombia at Santa Marta and the Magdalena Valley. The Santa Marta,
birds, however, are geographically interposed between Panama and Trini-
dad, while the Magdalena River form (true columbianus) is an isolated off-
shoot removed from the direct line of geographical intergradation.

Trogon macrurus, Scr. & Satv., P. Z. &., 1879, p. 585 (Remedios and Neché).

Inhabits the humid Tropical Zone of the Atrato and Magdalena Valleys.
When he described this bird Gould was evidently unaware of its range, but
in the second edition of his Monograph of the Trogons (1875) he writes: “I
doubt whether it is to be found beyond the district included between the
lower region of the river Magdalena and the Isthmus of Panama as far as
the base of the mountainous region of Veragua.”’ So far as Colombia is
concerned, this statement is approximately correct but the species does not
appear to have been recorded from west of the Canal Zone in Panama.
Singularly enough the west Ecuadorian form of this species is, or is very
near, C. m. melanurus of Amazonia.

Some difficulty is experienced in distinguishing females of macrourus
from females of C. massena australis, but macrourus has a relatively longer
tail which is longer instead of shorter than the wing, the bill is usually
shorter and relatively narrower, and the wing-coverts and inner wing-quills
are as a rule more strongly vermiculated with white than in australis, some
individuals of which are wholly without these-white markings on the wings.

After comparison with an essentially topotypical series from Santa
Marta, I refer to this form our specimens from the Magdalena Valley and
western slope of the Eastern Andes as far south as Chicoral. These birds
have the ventral region darker, the rectrices are blacker, and a bird from
Puerto Berrio is deeper above than true columbiane. They thus show an
approach toward P. ¢. nigricrissa of western Colombia, which, however, is
darker above and has much more black on the ventral region.

inhabits the Tropical and Subtropical Zones in western Ecuador and
western Colombia, extending in Colombia eastward to the eastern slope of
the Central Andes. Specimens from Antioquia east of the Western Andes
approach columbiana, but on the whole, are nearer nigricrissa.

Much against my will I find myself compelled to adopt the name nigri-
crissa (Cab. ex Sel.) for this form rather than cauce Stone.

Sclater first used this name in connection with three specimens collected
by Fraser at Babahoyo, western Ecuador and, shortly after, applied it to a
specimen or specimens secured by the same collector at Esmeraldas, western
Ecuador (P. Z. S., 1862, p. 285 and p. 297). In neither case, however, did
he publish a description and the name nigricrissa up to this point, is a nomen
nudum.

In 1862, however, Cabanis, having before him “ein Fraser’ sches original-
exemplar von Equador,” noted its close relation to the Costa Rican bird but
said that, as its name indicated, the form was distinguished by its black
crissum, a statement which, in view of the definiteness of the locality given, .
and the character of the form concemed may, I think, be accepted as a suf-
ficiently adequate description of the race; and, on this assumption, I give
western Ecuador as the type-locality. Should this view not be considered
tenable the name could date from its publication later in the same year
1917] Chapman, Distribution of Bird-life in Colombia. 321

(Cab. Mus. Hein., IV, i, p. 85). The description here given by Cabanis
may apply to certain Antioquian specimens which, while not typical’ of
nigricrissa, as. stated above, are nearer to that form than to columbiana.

Thus while Cabanis describes the tibize of his Colombian specimen as
“nigricantibus,” a term applied also to other forms, its ventral region and .
crissum are described as “nigris,” a statement which is applied, and will
apply only to the form here under consideration. Itis true that the meas-
urement given by Cabanis for the tail of his specimen (ten inches) is shorter
than that of the bird to which I apply his name. This, however, may be
said of all three of the Colombian forms of Piaya and the measurement
given is apparently, therefore, either an error or is taken from a specimen
in which the tail was not fully developed. It is not, however, in my opinion
necessary to resort to this second description of nigricrissa, Cabanis’ treat-
ment of the form in J. f. O. (J. ¢.) being sufficiently definite to admit of the
application of the name, in accordance with Sclater’s intention, to the west
Ecuador form.

These facts, consequently, in connection with those presented under the
following form, appear to warrant the use of the name nigricrissa of which,
therefore, cauce Stone becomes a synonym.

Plyrrhococcyx} mesurus Cas., Mus. Hein., IV, I, 1862, p. 83 (Bogotd).
Piaya cayana nigricrissa Auct. nec. Cab.

Two forms of Piaya inhabit the Bogoté region, P. c. mesura and P. c.
columbiana. The first occurs on the eastern slopes of the Eastern Andes,
and, singularly enough, on both eastern and western slopes of the Andes at
the head of the Magdalena Valley; the second, occurs on the slopes of the
Eastern Andes west of Bogot4 and in the Magdalena Valley at least as far
south as Chicoral.

Previous authors have considered Cabanis’ name mesura as applicable
to the western slope bird and have, consequently, synonymized it with co-
lumbiana; but although western slope specimens are not typical of colwm-
biana, they are too near that race to make it probable that Cabanis, after
describing columbiana (I. c. p. 82), would, on the next page, describe as new
a bird which is not separable from it. Of more importance, however, is the
fact that Cabanis’ description of mesura will not apply to the western slope
322 Bulletin American Museum of Natural History. [Vol. XXXVI,

bird while it does apply to the bird from the eastern slope. The latter is
distinguished chiefly by the comparative blackness of all but the central
tail-feathers, seen from below, a character which at once separates it from
the other Colombian forms. Moreover, compared with specimens from
west of Bogoté (which in the color of the upperparts agree with true colum-
biana) mesura as, Cabanis states, has the upperparts “wenig lebhafter als
bei C. (= P.) colombianus.”

A specimen from La Palma, in the Central Andes at the head of the
Magdalena Valley, has the tail longer than in Buena Vista and Quetame
specimens, but, in color, I can detect no differences between two specimens
from this locality, two from Andalucia (w. slope E. Andes, 3000 ft.) and
others from the eastern slope of the Eastern Andes. In view of the fact
that this species ranges upward to the Subtropical Zone, it is not improbable
that this race has entered the upper Magdalena region over the Andalucia
pass of the Eastern Andes, the altitude of which is only 7000 feet.

Char. subsp.— Similar to C. m. maculicoronatus Lawr., but larger, bill stouter,

male with pectoral band wider; flanks, in male, more heavily marked with black.

Inhabits the Tropical Zone of the Pacific coast at least as far south as
Buenaventura and, at the north, extends eastward through this zone east
of the Atrato to Magdalena drainage at Remedios. Specimens from Puerto
Valdivia have less black on the sides and flanks than in typical rubrila-
teralis, and are therefore more like pirrensis in color, but in general size they
agree with rubrilateralis.

Two females from Rio Salaqui have the side-patch mainly vermilion
rather than mainly orange and thus resemble rudrilaterales in color, but in
measurements they agree with maculicoronatus and are thus intermediate
between the two. They should be referred to pirrensis Nels.

further emphasizes the faunal affinities of the western lower Atrato Valley
with eastern Panama.

Except for a smaller amount of black on the sides in the male, pirrensis
agrees in color with rubrilateralis but in size it is nearer maculicoronatus.
In the shape of its bill, however, examination of Nelson’s series of seven
specimens in connection with those in our own collection from Salaqui, shows
that, in the adult, it possesses characters of its own. In rubrilateralis and
maculicoronatus the bill has the same general relative proportions, it being
simply longer and deeper in the former; but the bill of pirrensis differs from
both that of the other two forms in having the outline of the culmen less
evenly rounded, more angular, with the apex slightly in advance of the nos-
tril, while its base is more compressed laterally and more elevated into a
well-defined ridge, which leaves on each side a distinct shelf at the anterior
edge of which the nostril opens.

The differences in question are difficult to.express by measurements but
aré pronounced in the specimens themselves.

Richardson secured a single male of this species at Ricaurte. It differs
from five Ecuador (Esmeraldas and Chone) specimens in having the fore-
head scarlet or scarlet-red rather than orange-chrome, while the sides of the
crown are more broadly black, the whitish central area being, therefore,
more restricted. Should these differences prove constant the Ricaurte
form would constitute a well-marked race. In any event, the occurrence
of squamatus in southwestern Colombia, emphasizes the close faunal rela-
tionships of this region with northwestern Ecuador rather than with west-
ern Colombia.

Common in the forests of the Tropical Zone at the eastern base of the
Eastern Andes. J have seen no Peruvian specimens but Hellmayr (Nov.
Zool., XTV, 1907, p. 82) states that while “specimens from Eastern Ecuador
have, as a rule, the forehead and crown paler and less brownish. .. . those
from Bogota are exactly like the Peruvian ones.”

Capito auratus intermedius Berl. & Hart., to which J refer four males and
two females from the Cunucunuma River near Mt. Duida, may be readily
distinguished by its orange-margined rump, unspotted throat of the female
and comparative absence of spots below and brighter forehead in the male.
I am, however, unable to distinguish two topotypical males of “C. auran-
titcinctus’”’ Dalmas from the Caura River, Venezuela, from the four males
from Duida. All, except one from the Caura, show an orange tinge on the
abdomen and all have the rump margined with orange. If, therefore, the
Duida specimens truly represent intermedius, I am unable to appreciate
the characters of aurantticinctus so far as the specimens at hand are con-
cerned.

This is a species of the Tropical Zone of the Pacific and eastward through

Andes to the Subtropical Zone. In the Pacific coast region this bird occurs
with Ramphastos ambiguus abbrevictus (Cab.). Aside from their larger
size, our nineteen specimens of swainsont have (in the dried skin) the basal
and lateral areas of the bill with more or less red or buffy olive tinged with
red, or with usually some indication of red at the posterior margin; whereas,
eleven specimens of abbreviatus have the same part of the bill black without
a trace of red. .

Nine specimens from the Tropical Zone of the Pacific coast of Colombia
are smaller with shorter, more vertically compressed bills (in which the‘ keel’
of the culmen shows to its base) than specimens from the Bogoté region to
which, as I have shown above, the name ambiguus is applicable. This small
form ranges from Panama southward through the Tropical Zone of western
Colombia and western Ecuador, and doubtless extends eastward through
northern Antioquia at least to the Magdalena Valley, though a specimen
from Puerto Valdivia on the lower Cauca approaches ambiguus particularly
in the size of the bill (see beyond).

I have seen no specimens from Puerto Cabello, Venezuela whence Ca-
banis ! states his type of abbreviatus came, but his description of this bird
seems to indicate that it is a specimen of the small Tropical Zone form of
ambiguus, and I, therefore, provisionally accept his name.

In six males the bill measures from 175 to 198 mm. On the ground of
their larger size, therefore, I refer our specimens to cuvieri, of which, how-
ever, I have no authentic specimens. Unfortunately the collector made
no notes on the color of the bill in the fresh specimen, but in three of these
five birds there is an indication of red about half an inch from the base of
the maxilla near the yellow culmen streak, suggesting therefore an approach
toward R. inca. The occurrence of this species at Barrigon brings it into
the same region in which we secured R. culminatus.

to he referred to this species. Three of them have the “snow-white’”’ breast
and therefore agree with Gould’s description, and one has a faint tinge of
yellow on the breast and therefore resembles his plate (Monog. Ramphast.,

- This bird appears to be restricted to the Subtropical Zone of the Easterh
Andes. Our four specimens were all collected by Gonzales at Subia, west
of Bogoté. In addition to the lack of red in the bill, this form apparently
has the black of the nape extending somewhat further on to the back, arid
the chestnut of the thighs slightly deeper than in spilorhynchus. Since,
however, the last-named race is intermediate between nigrirostris and occt-
dentalis, it seems not improbable that nigrirostris may intergrade with
spilorhynchus. One of our specimens shows a faint indication of red at the
base of the maxilla both near the nostril and at the side. |

dios,” possibly came from above Salmon’s station).

Three specimens from the Central Andes while, in a measure interme-
diate, are evidently to be referred to this form rather than to the one from
the Western Andes, for which I have proposed the name occidentalis. While
all three have more red on the upper mandible than in a specimen from
Ecuador, two have only the faintest indication of red at the base of the lower
mandible, while in a third this mark is but slightly more evident.

True spilorhynchus, so far as I can learn, has no red on the lower mandible
while the red on the maxilla is comparatively restricted. An Ecuador speci-
men in our collection is so colored, and in his description of the race Gould
(1. ¢.) states that it differs from nigrirostris in the bill being shorter and
broader and much more robust, and colored with obscure brownish red at-
the base of the upper mandible. The differences in size and form do not
hold, but the absence of red on the lower mandible is apparently a distinctive
character of spilorhynchus. Sclater (P. Z. S., 1858, p. 75) writes that “Napo,
specimens have an obsolete orange band at the base of the upper mandible
which extends rather more forward in front of the nostrils.” ‘

Inhabits the Subtropical Zone of the Western Andes, except at the north-

Hellmayr (P. Z. S. 1911, p. 1218) has shown that Gould’s pheolemus is
based on the Concordia, Antioquia bird and not on the one occurring at
Merida, Venezuela, which Gould erroneously referred to pheolemus. The
latter form is described by Gould as having the “throat deep grayish blue,”
whereas, the Merida bird, Hellmayr states, has the throat white and is
referable to albivitta. ,

An error has evidently been made, therefore, in the Catalogue of the
British Museum (Vol. XIX, p. 158) in designating as the type of pheolemus
a specimen in the Gould collection from Venezuela, rather than one from
Concordia. The case is further complicated by the fact that the form of
this bird inhabiting the western slope of the Central Andes and northern
end of the Western Andes can be referred to neither albivitta nor pheolemus,
and I have therefore described it under the name Awacorhamphus albivitta
griseigularts.

humid zone pass through the Valle Dupar to the Maracaibo region we enter
the range of G@. r. brevirostris, which, according to Cory’s measurements, has
a shorter bill than any bird in our series. Additional specimens from Vene-

believed his type came (cf. Mon. Jacanas and Puff-Birds, p. 19) as the type-

a ‘Bogota’ specimen and, since Buena Vista and Villavicencio are in the
heart of the eastern Bogota region, while few if any ‘Bogoté’ skins appear
to have come from the vicinity of La Morelia and Florencia, where, indeed
Miller secured numbers of species, not before recorded from Colombia,
there is reason to believe that Sclater’s name is properly applicable to the
Buena Vista and Villavicencio form. Furthermore, the figure of Sclater’s
type (Mon. Jacamars and Puff-Birds, pl. xi, left hand figure) agrees with
this form rather than with that from the Caqueté region. I have therefore
described the latter as new. Its characters, as the preceding diagnosis in-
dicates, are pronounced, but it is not improbable that the differences shown
by my series may be in part seasonal, since the Caqueté birds, taken in
July, appear to be in fresher plumage than those from Buena Vista and
Villavicencio, which were taken in March and April.

unknown locality, is described as having. the “middle of the belly pure
white,” and this fact in connection with Sclater’s subsequent reference of
his type to Brachygalba lugubris Sw. (Cat. Bds. B. M., XIX, p. 172) indi-
cates that we are not here concerned with that form. Nevertheless, Tac-
zanowski (Orn. Perou, III, p. 120) refers a specimen from Pebas, Peru to
“imornata” and Sclater (J. c.) lists a specimen from the same locality under
lugubris, while ‘fulviventris’ he records from Sarayacu and Rio Napo,
Eguador. :

Specimens in our collection from the Rio Napo are referable to the form
here described as caquete, which name can doubtless also be applied to the
Sarayacu examples, but the Pebas birds seem to require redetermination.

Found by us only at La Morelia where Miller secured six specimens.
The occurrence of this Amazonian species in Bogota collections as early as
1845 shows the wide area covered by native collectors at that early date.
Two of our specimens sexed as “ 9 ” have the ear-coverts white, indicating
that in this species the sexes are alike. Possibly, supposed “females” with-
out the white auriculars, are in reality specimens of G. purustanus Goeldi!

(1610) Notharcus hyperrhynchus leucocrissus (Scl.).
Bucco leucocrissus Scu., P. Z. 8., 1860, p. 284 (Babahoyo, w. Ecuador).

Represented by two specimens from Honda. These appear to agree
with one from Chone, western Ecuador (which may be considered topo-
typical of leucocrissus) two from the Panama R. R. Line (McLeannan and.
Galbraith) and one from Tapaliza, eastern Panama, and differ from six Nica-
raguan specimens, which I assume represent dysont, in having the pectoral
band conspicuously wider, the flanks more heavily barred, the margins to
the rectrices narrower, more sharply defined and less extended down the
inner vane, the outer primary black at the tip, instead of narrowly margined
with white. The material in question clearly represents two forms, for the
more southern of which the name leucocrissus (Scl.) appears to be applicable;
but a specimen from Tehuantepec agrees more nearly with leucocrissus in
the markings of' rectrices and outer primary, though in flanks and pectoral
band it is like dysoni, and a specimen from EI Pilar, northeastern Venezuela,
seems to be near leucocrissus though the pectoral band is evidently widened
by the make of the skin. A specimen said to be from Paré, has the bill
larger (culmen 46 mm.) than in any of those above-mentioned, while the
pectoral band is as narrow as in dysoni and the flanks heavily barred as in
the Honda and Panama specimens. Doubtless it represents N. h. hyper-
rhynchus. .

Valley and the Pacific coast north through Panama to Veragua, south to
Guayaquil.

I provisionally place under the above name our twenty-two specimens
of this species. Among these two from the vicinity of Honda agree with
the figure of the type of radiatus in being buffy white below, but a third
specimen from near Honda is much more fulvous below, while one from
Puerto Berrio, but a short distance down the Magdalena from Honda, has
the underparts rich fulvous and agrees in color with specimens from Panama.
This type of coloration is also shown by Sclater’s figure of a specimen from
Neché, and by the remaining birds in our series.

Possibly the pale type of color may be restricted to the region about
Honda at the junction of the humid and arid Cauca-Magdalena fauna,
while birds of the fulvous type (Bucco fulvidus Salv. & Godm., Biol. Centr.-
Am. Aves, II, 1896, p. 514, Veragua) occupy the humid portion of this
fauna. I know of no similar case of distribution, however, and since the
recognition of fulvidus would require that one of our Honda specimens be
referred to that form, the other two to radiatus, I prefer forthe present to
consider them as one form which possibly may be locally dichromatie.
Honda specimens average the smallest of the series.

(1637) Malacoptila panamensis poliopis Sci.
Malacoptila poliopis Scu., P. Z. 8., 1862, p. 86, pl. viii (Esmeraldas, Ecuador).

Inhabits the Tropical Zone of the Pacific coast, north at least to Cisneros.
Comparison of nine males and six females of true poliopis from western
Ecuador (including four males from Esmeraldas) with four males and eight
females from Panama and Costa Rica, shows that the former differ from the
latter mainly, if not solely, in the deeper color of the breast. In the male
this is cinnamon-rufous in poliopis, and ochraceous-tawny in panamensis.
In the female of poliopis the breast is slightly deeper than in the male of
panamensis while the female of panamensis has the breast ochraceous-buff.

Having thus determined the differentiating characters of these two
forms, I have attempted to identify our ten males and five females from
western Colombia. As might be expected, they show every stage of inter-
gradation between the two extremes. Some specimens could be referred
to one form as well as to the other, but on the whole specimens from north
of San José are nearer to panamensis than to poliopis. Most of them are
quite typical of the northern race, while a female from Los Cisneros is equally
typical of poliopis.

evident that the two completely merge in western Colombia.

A male from Buenavista, Narifio, is more heavily streaked below and
the ventral region is deeper rufous than in two specimens from Zamora,

the type of distribution which I believe to have been evolved by the Andean
uplift.-:

Hargitt (Cat. Bds. B. M., XVIII, p. 31) has called attention to the large

ut Ecuadorian birds are but little larger than measurements given by
Taczanowski (I. c.) and are evidently very near true brevirostris. As the
appended table shows, however, birds from the Central Andes are much
larger. I can detect no differences in color, but those in size appear to be
constant, and may warrant the separation of a northern form of brevi-
rostris. It is surprising to find that three specimens from Merida agree
with brevirostris rather than rivolit in color; while instead of showing the
progressive increase in size from the south northward, exhibited by other
birds in our series, these Merida birds are nearer specimens from Ecuador
than those from Bogota.

no form of this species is known from the Tropical Zone of the Pacific coast
of Colombia but that in the Tropical Zone of the Pacific coast of Ecuador
it is represented by C. r. rubripileus Salvad. and Fest., a smaller form in which
the throat is usually spotted quite to. the base of the bill, the rump paler,

teen specimens) while the female has less red in the crown.

"A female from La Candela in the Central Andes at the head of the Mag-

gularts and rubiginosus, and although not a geographical intermediate, it
suggests the intergradation of these forms. It has the throat spotted with
white and well-defined black malar stripe and unbarred rectrices of gularis,
but the crown.is gray, the red being confined to the nuchal region; the rump
is nearly the color of the back and the breast is narrowly barred with buffy

» as in rubiginosus. .

colored above than a specimen of punctipectus in similar plumage from Ma-

ripa on the lower Orinoco, and is nearer in color and pattern to an immature:
female from the headwaters of the Huallaga River, Peru: Two adults from

Moyobamba, Peru, loaned me by the Field Museum, are somewhat darker

may be assumed typically to represent true punctigula. The latter are,

however, slightly smaller and have a shorter bill.

pared with true punctigula of which, thanks to Mr. Penard, I have three

having the back warbler-green instead of antique-brown, and in being larger

underparts and in the much narrower, almost obsolete bars of the back.

p. 611 (Cali).

Chrysoptilus punctigularis Scv. & Sauy., P. Z.8., 1879, p. 583 (Remedios).

Char. subsp.— Differs from all other described forms of Chrysoptilus punctigula,
except C. p. ujhelyii, in having the throat white streaked with black instead of black
spotted with white; differsfrom C. p. ujhelyti in being darker, with the spots below,
particularly on the flanks, larger, the upperparts and wings with clearly defined broad
black bars (much narrower and nearly obsolete, dorsally, in ujhelyii); differing from
C. p. punctipectus in the pattern of the throat, as described above, in being browner
above and in having the spots of the underparts larger, more numerous, and extend-
ing to the flanks and abdominal region.

Inhabits the Tropical Zone of Colombia west of the Eastern Andes and
south of the semi-arid Caribbean coastal region. .

The occurrence of Chrysoptilus punctigula punctipectus in the Tropical
Zone of the eastern slope of the Eastern Andes and of C. p. striatigularis in
this zone on the western slope of the same range brings both forms into the
Bogoté region and hence into ‘Bogota’ collections. In default of proper
data, their well-marked racial differences have evidently been considered to
represent individual variations and we have, therefore, an additional illus-
tration of the confusion wrought by the use of unlabeled skins from a region
containing at least two distinct faunas and double the number of zones.

Our specimens are all from the Tropical Zone of northern Colombia and
the Magdalena Valley, as fat south as Chicoral. Five males and five females
from Honda and vicinity (ney be considered as topotypical of neglectus
Rich., while of sancte-marte Bangs we have an excellent topotypical series
of twenty-six specimens. Careful comparison of this and other material
from intermediate localities fails to reveal any constant differences between
these alleged forms, In specimens from Santa Marta the bill averages larger,
but the difference is bridged by individual variation and is certainly not
sufficient in itself to warrant the recognition of two forms. - In color, Mag-
dalena Valley birds agree with those from Santa Marta; in both the red of
the crown is continuous with that of the nape.

In view of the evident identity of Colombian birds, I fail to see how we
can avoid accepting Cabanis’ name, based on Barranquilla specimens, for
this form (ef. also Ridgway, Bull. 50, VI, pp. 53, 75).

Comparison of Cassin’s type, a female in the National Museum, and nine
specimens from eastern Panama (Cana, Marraganti, Chepigana, El Real,
Tapaliza, Boca de Cupe) with our eight specimens of loricatus, shows that
mentalis is a strongly marked form which may be distinguished from the
more southern race by the almost entire absence of bars on the back and
inner wing-quills, the smaller black area in the feathers of the crown, more
ochraceous underparts on which the black markings are narrower and a
more extensive ochraceous-tawny area on the throat, which in the male
separates the black markings of the breast from the red of the upper
throat.

Examination of Lawrence’s type of Celeus squamatus shows that it is
referable to this form.

Eastern Andes and eastern slope of the Western Andes of the Subtropical
Zone. The occurrence of this form at Rio Toché and El Eden, and of P.
granadensis at Salento, indicates the faunal affinities of the first-named
localities with the Magdalena Valley and of the last with the Cauca
Valley.

Nine males from the Magdalena Valley have the crown streaked with
scarlet, but a male from La Frijolera in the Lower Cauca region has the
crown streaked with cadmium-orange. It thus resembles a male from
Tacarcuna in eastern Panama, but in other respects these two males and
also two females from eastern Panama (Tacarcuna and Tapaliza) agree
with P. o. olivaceus.

In the color of the crown-stripes these males agree with P. o. flavotinctus
of western Panama and Costa Rica, but in the jet blackness of the crown
the Frijolera specimen resembles olivaceus, while the Panama specimens
show an approach toward flavotinctus. They are thus intermediate between
these two race3, instead of olivaceus and panamensis of the Canal Zone as
we should expect. In any event it is important to note that representa-
tives of olivaceus occur at La Frijolera and at Tacarcuna, while at Peque
southwest of the first-named locality Picumnus granadensis antioquensis
occurs,

A specimen from Barbacoas agrees with an essentially topotypical
series from Esmeraldas southward, in Ecuador, of which five males have
the crown-stripes cadmium-yellow. In its more olivaceous color and
streaked under-parts this race is much nearer true olivaceus than to canus,
its nearest geographical congener.

It is worthy of note that, as in other cases, the Barbacoas form of this
species agrees with the one from Ecuador rather than with the one from the
more northern part of the Colombian coast.

Picumnus olivaceus granadensis Heti., P. Z.8., 1911, p. 1189 (Primavera, 5200

Inhabits the Tropical Zone of the Pacific coast, north of Barbacoas, and
the Cauca Valley, ranging upward to the Subtropical Zone in the Western
Andes and western slope of the Central Andes. Represented at the northern
end of the Western Andes by P. g. antioquensis. The occurrence of the
olivaceous races (olivaceus, panamensis, harterti) at the east, north, and
south of the range of this species, the absence of intergrading specimens,
and its strongly marked characters indicate the specific distinctness of this
form. Furthermore, its stability is indicated by its occurrence in the humid
coast region (Cisneros, etc.) and in the comparatively dry Cauca Valley
(Rio Frio) without apparent change. On the other:hand,-we have yet to
find granadensis and one of the three forms mentioned above asseciated;-
they have, however, been found in the same faunal area. Thus, at Bar-
bacoas we have taken the richly-colored P. olivaceus hartertt and at Cisneros
wholly typical examples of granadensis with whitish, comparatively un-
streaked underparts and grayish back. If, therefore, granadensis is a
representative form of olivaceus we should have the palest form occurring
in what is doubtless the most humid portion of the area concerned, To my
mind it does not follow that granadensis is a representative form of olivaceus
merely because it occurs in an area where no-other species of Picumnus is
found which could be so considered. Western Colombia is so often with-
out forms common to Ecuador and Panama, northern and central Colom-
bia, that the absence of some form of olivaceus between the ranges of P. o.
olivaceus and P. o. harterti need not surprise us.

This, the most common species of the genus, is found in all three ranges
of the Andes where it is restricted in the main, to the Temperate Zone.
Loeal conditions bring it down occasionally to the zone below. There is
some variation in size and intensity of color in our series but it appears to
be individual, and on the whole our specimens agree with one from Val-
paraiso, Chile. The juvenal plumage is more or less washed with rusty,
paler below, and is never as distinctly barred as in S. cinereicollis and S.
micropterus, the bars, when present, being comparatively obsolete. There
is no indication of bars in the tail or of white in the crown.-

This widely distributed species has been generally confused with Scyta-
lopus magellanicus (Gmel.) which, as shown by thirteen specimens recently
secured by Beck in the Cape Horn region for the Brewster-Sanford collec-
tion, is a wholly different species.!

throughout, the underparts paler than the upperparts, the center of the abdomen
grayer than surrounding parts; tail shorter, the feathers narrower and softer, their
barbs, apically, more or less separated; bill shorter, feet and tarsi more slender ;
apparently closely resembling, and perhaps representing, S. unicolor Salv. of Peru,
but much smaller, the female of the same color as the male.

The juvenal plumage is evidently conspicuously barred above and below with
cinnamon-buff and therefore resembles that of .S. griseicollis rather than that of S.

Miller and Boyle secured an excellent series of ten specimens of this
species in that elevated region near the northern end of the Western Andes
known as the Paramillo. In general coloration it resembles Myornis senilis
with which, however, it has no close relation. Although approaching in
size and superficially resembling Seytalopus niger (Swains.), the more loosely
constructed rectrices and differences in the color of the young indicate that
it is not a representative of that species.

shows it to be based on the juvenal plumage of this species. Mr. Bangs
sends me, in addition to the types of griseicollis and squamzger, a Lafresnaye
specimen (No. 4854) labelled “Scytalopus erythropterus Lafr.” I cannot
find that this name was published. The bird is a not fully adult specimen
of Scytalopus griseicollis.

The whitish abdomen, unbarred tawny flanks and rump, and brownish
tail, distinguish the adult of this species. The juvenal plumage is con-
spicuously and evenly barred both below and above.

the flanks, ventral region, and under tail-coverts barred with black and
ochraceous-tawny. A young male from the same locality is passing from
juvenal into adult plumage. It resembles the adult but has more barred
feathers in wings and on the nape, and the three remaining tail-feathers of
‘the juvenal plumage are distinctly barred with black and ochraceous-tawny.

Scytalopus micropterus Scu., P. Z. 8., 1858, p. 69 (Napo, Ecuador).
Scytalopus analis Auct. (not of Lafr. = Triptorhinus paradoxus Kittl.; type
examined).

Not uncommon in the denser low growth of the heavy forests of the
Subtropical Zone of all three ranges and occasionally extending upward to
the lower border of the Temperate Zone and rarely downward to the Tropi-
cal Zone. All our twenty-four specimens have the flanks, lower abdomen,
rump and upper tail-coverts barred with rusty black. The white crown-
patch appears to be a purely individual character not dependent upon age,
sex, season or locality. It is well developed in some immature specimens
and wanting in others, is present or absent in both sexes, and in specimens
from the same locality. Nine specimens possess it to a greater or less de-
gree, fifteen are without it.

On examination of Lafresnaye’s type of “Mer [ulaxis] analis”’ (Rev.
~ Zool., 1840, p. 104) loaned me by Mr. Bangs, I find it to be an adult specimen
of Triptorhinus paradozus Kittl., a fact confirming Lafresnaye’s belief (J. c.)
that his specimen came from “Paraguay ou du Chili.” Kittlitz’s name has
nine years priority and Lafresnaye’s consequently becomes a pure synonym
of it. The bird hitherto known as Scytalopus analis (Lafr.) will apparently
therefore become Scytalopus micropterus Scl., as above. I have seen no
Napo specimens but our collection contains a Bogoté skin labelled by Sclater
“ Agathopus micropterus.” The generic name he subsequently abandoned.

Char. sp—In general color resembling Scytalopus micropterus micropterus Scl.
but somewhai paler, the tail brownish, the rump and flanks tawny, unbarred as in
S. griseicollis Lafr., bill black, as in micropterus.

This species, which further illustrates the apparent exhaustlessness of
the Bogota region as well as of the genus Scytalopus, is based on a specimen
presented to the American Museum by Hermano Apolinar Maria, the emi-
nently efficient Director of the Instituto de la Salle in Bogoté.

Found ouly in the Tropical Zone of Amazonian Colombia. An adult
male is considerably smaller than one from British Guiana, has the back
browner and with fewer black margins, while the breast is paler and the
abdominal region more suffused with ochraceous. If the differences named
are constant, the bird from the base of the Andes is deserving of separation.
An adult female more nearly resembles the Guiana male in the color of the
parts named. I have no female from Guiana.

difficult to collect. We have also two females from the western slope of the
Central Andes above the lower Cauca. In color and size of the bill they
appear to be intermediate between castaneiceps and chocoensis, but in default
of females of that race for comparison I refer them to castaneiceps.

Char. subsp.— Similar to C. ¢. castaneiceps but much darker, wings and tail
shorter and bill longer; male with back mummy-brown with an olivaceous cast
instead of deep neutral gray (with an olivaceous wash in immature specimens);
crown chestnut instead of Sanford’s brown, this color darker posteriorly but reaching
as far back as the crown-cap in castaneiceps; underparts dark mouse-gray in place
of deep neutral gray; the center of the belly whitish the flanks heavily washed with
olivaceous.

of crown evidently more extensive and size smaller. Wing, 68; tail, 39;

Inhabits the Tropical Zone of the Pacific coast. I find also that two
males and three females from Rio Frio, in the Cauca Valley, are to be re-
ferred to this form rather than to granadensis of the Bogoté region. The
males have the lower tail-coverts black tipped with white, and the females
are fully as dark as specimens from the coast. A male from La Manuel-
ita, in the Cauca Valley, is less typical, the under tail-coverts being less
black, their white margins broader, but it may be referred to transandeana
rather than to granadensis.

The appearance of characters of humid Pacific coast forms in the speci-
mens from the comparatively arid Cauca Valley, indicates that the charac-
ters may have been acquired before the form entered the Valley.

The character of “under tail-coverts cinereous with a white apical edge
preceded by a distinct blackish subterminal band” holds good for four of
our five males. In the fifth (from Villavicencio), the lower tail-coverts do
not differ materially from those of average Pacific coast males. The bill,
however, is perceptibly smaller than in true transandeana.

Two females (Buena Vista, 1; Villavicencio, 1) are less deeply colored
above than Pacific coast females and show slightly more contrast between
the tone of the cap and the color of the back.

11 am indebted to Dr. Richmond for calling my attention to the fact that the publication of that
part (No. 6) of the Proceedings in which this description occurs was announced at the meeting of
the Academy held April 27, 1869. (Cf. Proceedings, 1869, p. 13.) The last part of the Proceedings
of the Zoological Society, according to the covers of the numbers of this volume for 1868, was pub-
lished in March of the following year. The cover for the third part of this volume, however, bears
the date “April, 1869.” It does not seem probable, however, that the number, due in March, was
issued after April 27, the date of publication of the description of Lawrence's Thamnophilus virgatus,
and I therefore accept Sclater’s name as, in my opinion, having priority.

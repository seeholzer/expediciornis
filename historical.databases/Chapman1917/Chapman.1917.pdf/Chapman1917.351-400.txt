Goldman in size, they are nearer americana in color; the males have the
breast-patch deeper and more extended anteriorly, the females have the
breast-band more solid, less broken than in isthmica. From C. a. cabanisi,
of which I have only one specimen, a female from Lima in the Brewster-
Sanford Collection, the Colombian birds differ in their smaller. size, smaller
bill and more buffy anterior underparts.

I detect no constant difference in color between our twenty-one west
Colombian specimens, and five from La Morelia and Florencia in the Ca-
queté region; in the latter the rufous areas average darker, the rectrices
basally greener, and as a rule, the rufous extends somewhat farther on to
the abdominal region which is less tinged with blue. The main difference
between the two series, however, is to be found in the central tail-feathers
which, in the adult, appear usually to have racket-shaped tips in semirufa
and to have their vanes entire in martii. Thus, out of twenty adults of
semirufa, only one has the central tail-feathers non-spatulate; while none
of our five specimens of martii has the racket-shaped tips on the central
feathers.

These observations confirm those already made by Hellmayr (Nov.
Zook; 1907, p. 403) who states that in five specimens from the upper Ama-
zon the tail is not spatulated while “in a large series of U. m. semirufa from
Bogota collections, western Ecuador, Costa Rica, etc., the tail-feathers are
nearly uniform blue and the middle pair invariably spatulated in the adults.”

It is important to observe that so far:as.our speciinens go, the central
rectrices in martii do not show that breaking down in the barbs at their
attachment to the shaft, which is evident in the central tail-feathers of
semirufa along that portion of the shaft which is in process of losing its barbs.

Crypticus platyrhynchus Cass., Proc. Acad. N.S. Phila., 1860, p. 136 (R. Nercua).

Inhabits the Tropical Zone of western Ecuador northward to the Atrato
Valley in Colombia. I have seen no Ecuador specimens but, although
showing to a limited extent the decrease in size which occurs in this species,
as one advances toward the northern limit of its range, it seems evident that
the long-tailed, large-billed form of extreme western Colombia is referable
to that form.

Five specimens from Puerto Valdivia, in the lower Cauca, however, as
the appended table of measurements shows, are clearly intermediate be-
tween platyrhynchus and minor.

I follow Hellmayr (J. ¢.) in restricting the name platyrhynchus to the
Pacific coast form. The fact that this species was not definitely recorded
from Brazil until 1906 (Hellmayr, J. c.), in connection with the fact that it
1917.] Chapman, Distribution of Bird-life in Colombia. 269

was described as having spatulate central rectrices (a character unknown
in specimens from east of the Andes), makes it more than probable that
Leadbeater’s type did not come from “Brazil” as he stated. If, following
Ridgway (Bull. 50, VI, p. 471), we did not accept this view of the case,
pyrrholemus (Berl. & Stolz.) shown by Hellmayr to be the Brazilian form,
would become a synonym of platyrhynchus, leaving the broad-billed race of
western Ecuador without a name. In view of the facts stated and of the
action of previous authors this proceeding seems to me to be unnecessary.

’ Hellmayr states that in fourteen adult specimens of platyrhynchus-and
minor all have the central rectrices spatulate, but in our eighteen specimens
of these forms two adults have the vanes of the central rectrices entire-and
in a third they are nearly so.

An adult male from Florencia has the central rectrices fully developed
(see measurements beyond) and non-spatulate; both this character and
the locality indicate that it should be referred to this form, of which, how-
ever, I have no authentic specimens. Aside from the non-spatulate rec-
trices, which appear to characterize this form, it may be distinguished from
platyrhynchus by its shorter and narrower bill, while the specimen below
recorded has the tail bluer terminally than any of our eighteen specimens
from west of the Andes.

It is difficult to understand why four specimens from Puerto Valdivia
on the lower Cauca River, at the eastern base of the Western Andes, should
be referable to the Panama form rather than to E. p. platyrhynchus which
‘occurs on the opposite or western slope of the Western Andes, at Alto Bonito.
In color these specimens are nearer to Pacific coast birds than to Panama
birds, in general size, taking Hartert’s measurements of platyrhynchus (see
table beyond) for comparison, they are about intermediate between platyr-
hynchus and minor, but in the size of the bill they agree with the latter and
270 Bulletin American Museum of Natural History. |Vol. XXXVI,

the difference between the forms concerned is in this respect so marked that
one can not well refer the Puerto Valdivia birds to the large-billed Pacific
coast race. While it is true, therefore, that they are not typical of minor
they certainly do not differ from it sufficiently to warrant subspecific sepa-
ration, and quite as certainly they could not be referred to platyrhynchus.

Of minor I have four topotypical specimens from the Canal Zone, with
which five specimens from Tapaliza and Tacarcuna essentially agree.

On purely faunal grounds the latter should be referable to E. p. suboles
Nels., but none of our east Panama specimens has as large a bill as Mr.
Nelson’s measurements show that his type and only specimen of suboles
possesses. Either, therefore, the specimen on which suboles is based has
an abnormally large bill or the race is remarkably localized, and in view of
the fact that the locality whence the type comes is in the Tropical Zone, I
incline to the former theory.

in being slightly larger. Ridgway (Bull. U.S. N. M., 50, VI, p. 462) refers
two specimens from Honda and Ambalema to M. s. conexus Thayer & Bangs,
but with six topotypical specimens of that form and twenty-six of subru-
fescens from Santa Marta before me, I can detect no constant differences
on which to separate the Panama form.

variation in the intensity of coloratiop of the upperparts, but not one speci-
men in our series of some forty specimens of subrufescens has the underparts,
particularly the abdominal region, as deeply colored as in any one of these

It is distributed throughout the Tropical Zene, and under favorable con-
ditions ranges upward to the lower border of the Subtropical Zone. None
of our twenty-six specimens has the wing over 158 mm., and they therefore
presumably all represent the resident South American form. There is,
however, as usual in this species, much variation in color. A male from La
Candela, for example, is paler above and below than any one of ten speci-
’ mens from Santa Marta (N.. a. gilvus. Bangs), but a female from the same
locality is darker than the average “albicollis.” Specimens from the Pa-
cific coast average darker and smaller than those from the interior and doubt-
. less represent a local race, but I have not a sufficiently large series of true
albicollis to determine its characters satisfactorily.

however, has black (and that as a small broken band) on only the outer

Inhabits the Temperate Zone. In view of the fact that in Colombia, as
well as in Venezuela and Ecuador, most of our specimens of this bird were
taken from above 10,000 feet, I am inclined to regard an immature female
collected by Richardson at Tumaco, on the coast of southwestern Colombia,
as an accidental visitant at that point. This specimen, it should be added,
is considerably paler than any of our other twenty examples of this species.

(968a) Streptoprocne zonaris altissima Chapm.

Streptoprocne zonaris altissima CuapM., Bull. A.M. N. H., XX XIII, 1914, p. 604
(Laguneta, Col.).

Char. subsp.— Agreeing in size with S. z. zonaris of southern Brazil, but bill
heavier, the ridge of the culmen more prominent, general color, particularly of the
inner wing-quills and wing-coverts greener, forehead averaging paler, the breast-
band broader with the terminal half, rather than the terminal third, of its feathers
white, the edge of the wing, as far as the primary coverts and some of the lesser
coverts, distinctly margined with white; differs more pronouncedly from 8S, z.
albicincta in the characters named, and in its larger size.

The discovery that even birds of such exceptional power of flight as the
large Swifts, may have representative forms in zones separated by a few
thousand feet, is one of the most interesting results of our studies of zonal
distribution in Colombia. Streptoprocne zonaris albicincta is distributed
throughout the Tropical Zone of Colombia and ascends to at least the lower
border of the Subtropical Zone. The form here described, however, we have
taken in Colombia only at Laguneta, in the Temperate Zone (one specimen)
and on Mt. Pichincha, Ecuador (8 specimens). The differences between
altissima and albicincta are more striking than those which exist between
zonaris and albicincta. There is no indication of intergradation among our
twenty Colombian and Ecuadorian specimens of both forms, and it is not
probable, in my opinion, that albicincta and altissima intergrade inter se,
but that their connectant is true zonaris, The intergradation of altissima
with zonaris may reasonably be looked for, at some point where increasing
south latitude brings the Temperate Zone to the altitude at which zonaris
occurs, let us say northwestern Argentina, while the intergradation of al-
bicincta with zonaris may be looked for in that region south of the Amazon,
where the Amazonian forests merge into, or interdigitate, with the highlands
of southern Brazil.

stand as S. 3. minor (Lawr.), the type of which in the American Museum
agrees with the lowland form.

corded from e. Ecuador, cf. Hellm. Orn. Gesell. Bayern, VITI, 1908, p. 157)
which, so far as one.can judge from descriptions, it also resembles in color,
the belly and rump being grayer than specimens from the Central Andes,
identified as C. c. occidentalis.

A specimen taken by Fuertes at San Antonio, is our only representative
of this species from the Western Andes. It was not met with in the Central
Andes but was exceedingly abundant in the Eastern Andes at, and near,
Buena Vista. It appears to be mountain-inhabiting and was not secured
below 4000 feet.

The sexing of our nine specimens indicates that the rufous collar is worn
by adults of both sexes, and that immature birds of both sexes are without
it. Thus it is present in three females, one of which had the ovaries slightly
enlarged, and in one male; is almost or entirely absent in three females,
and indicated by only a slight rufous tint on the nape in one male.

Inhabits the Tropical Zone of the Pacific coast and eastward, into the
Magdalena Valley. Two specimens from “Ecuador” in the Elliot collec-
tion, one of which is labeled “a type,” have both mandibles strongly hooked
and more strongly toothed than in any one of our Colombian specimens.
In the latter indeed, the mandibular hook is absent in the adult males as
well as females. Possibly these differences may be of racial value, but the
proximity of Barbacoas, Col., to the probable type-locality of this species
(Tropical Zone west of Quito) and the agreement of our Barbacoas speci-
mens with those from farther north, argues against the variation in question
being geographical. Further material is needed, however, to solve this
interesting problem.

topotypes from Esmeraldas. Seven specimens from eastern Panama (El
Real; Cupe River; Capeti) while nearer frasert, indicate, as Hellmayr (l. ¢.)
has already surmised, the intergradation of fraseri with ruckert of western
Panama, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The east Panama form has the cin-
namon throat-patch brighter and more extensive, the underparts paler, the
tail greener than in frasert and thus very appreciably approaches ruckeri.
‘Two specimens from the Canal Zone while resembling Costa Rica birds
below have the back green with little or no brassy reflection and thus

Glaueis hirsuta Scu. &. Satv., P. Z.S., 1879, p. 528 (Sta. Elena).

Inhabits the Tropieal Zone at the eastern base of the Eastern Andes,
the Magdalena and Cauca Valleys, the lower Atrato Valley and eastern
Panama. The distribution of this species in Colombia agrees, therefore,
with that of those birds which evidently have entered the country from
Amazonia. (Compare, for example, that of Ostinops decumanus).

After comparison of our Colombian specimens and thirteen from eastern
Panama (R. Tuyra; R. Capeti) with the type and a topotype of affinis, I
follow Ridgway in referring birds from the region outlined to that race.

I have not, however, seen specimens of Glaucis hirsuta fusca Cory from
the southwest shores of Lake Maracaibo (Field Mus. Pub., 167, 1913, p. 286).

Glaucis hirsuta enea Hutim., P. Z.8., 1911, p. 1178 (Guineo, R. Calima).

Hellmayr (J. ¢.) has already shown that this species occurs on the Pacific
coast of Colombia and in northwestern Ecuador, and comparison of eight
specimens from San José, Barbacoas, and Esmeraldas, with two from Costa
Rica (including the type) and four from Nicaragua, confirms his views.
The range of the species is not, however, as he surmised, continuous, and
although it inhabits the Tropical Zone, it appears to have a distribu-
tion similar to that of the large group of Subtropical Zone species which
are unknown between Costa Rica or western Panama and northwestern
Colombia.

This fact, in connection with. the occurrence of Glaucis hirsuta affinis in
eastern Panama (see above), and the differences in color between enea and
hirsuta (cf. Ridgway, Bull. 50, V, p. 329) lead me to believe that these birds
are specifically distinct, as indeed Mr. Ridgway has -already surmised
(L.c.). .Aside from its more bronzy upperparts, our series confirms the state-
ment that. in enea the sexes are alike, the male as well as the female being
cinnamon below.

Oberholser (Proc. U. 8. N. M., XXIV, 1902, p. 313) has called attention
to the distinguishing characters of the form of this species inhabiting western
Ecuador, and has applied to it the name atrimentalis Lawr., a species which
has commonly been synonymized with striigularis. Examination of the
type, however, (Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 46225) shows that it belongs in the
group having the underparts cinnamon-rufous, the throat black. In the
coloration of these parts, and in its black auriculars, the type of atrimentalis
resembles longuemareus; the upperparts are greener than in striigularis
and the central tail-feathers are broader and more sharply pointed; the
lower mandible is bicolor not concolor as in longuemareus. A specimen from
Bogota agrees with the type of atrimentalis but has the back more coppery,

relationship with P. striigularis.

& Festa, however (Boll. Mus. Tor., XV, 1900, No. 368, p. 2) that the char-
acters assigned to this form are not of specific value. We have specimens
with a maximum and minimum, and intermediate amount of white from the

Inhabits the Tropical Zone. The identification of Colombian specimens
of Amazilis tzacatl is largely a matter of opinion. Deprive the specimens
listed below of their labels and probably no two ornithologists would agree
as to their proper names. Hellmayr (P. Z. S., 1911, p. 1183) restricts
A. t. jucunda to western Colombia including Antioquia, and applies the name
A. t. fuscicaudata (Fraser) to the form of eastern Colombia. Ridgway
(Bull. U. S. N. M., 50, p. 409) restricts the name jucunda to specimens from
western Ecuador and southwestern Colombia, and refers all other Colombian
specimens to the Central American form A. t. fzacatl. With an abundance of
material for examination, I incline to Ridgway’s views. - In specimens from
the Bogoté region the bill averages smaller, but the character is by no means
diagnostic and I cannot see any reason for recognizing an East Andean form.

Most of the specimens from western Colombia can be referred to one
form quite as easily as to the other, but on general faunal principles I limit

I can detect no diagnostic differences in the color of the upper mandible.
On the whole the Colombian birds are intergrades between tzacatl and
jucunda and, as stated above, it is purely a matter of opinion where the line
bounding the ranges of the two forms be drawn.

This species is widely distributed in western Gelemibia from the open
or semi-arid tropics up to the subtropics of the Western and Central Andes.

Since this species occurs up to the borders of the tableland of Ecuador
(Richardson secured it in the Valle de Cumbaza at an altitude of about
7000 feet on the slopes of Mt. Chimborazo) we are, I think, warranted in
accepting the vicinity of Quito as an actual type-locality. ‘Quito’ skins
agree with those from Cumbaza and the two series combined give what we

may doubtless consider a representative series of true melanorhynchus.
Using this series for comparison, I am unable to find any characters in our,
series of twenty-five adult males from western Colombia, by which the
Colombian bird may be separated from the species I assume to be melan-
orhynchus. There are some slight geographic variations in size and color,
birds from northwestern Colombia averaging smaller and possibly duller
on crown and belly, but the differences are too inconstant to be of diagnostic
value.

I have seen no authentic specimens of the bird known as C: pumilus
Gould. The characters usually assigned to it, however, are covered by the
variations shown by the series here under consideration.

appear to be nearer verticeps and resemble Ecuadorian specimens of that
species in their greener backs and shorter, less deeply forked tails.

My six adult males from Ecuador are all referable to verticeps. Unfortu-
nately they are without locality and therefore throw no light on the distribu-
tion of this species in that country. Specimens from Buenavista, however,
in southwestern Colombia near the boundary of Ecuador are referable to
fannyi, and it is not improbable that the coastal form of humid north-
western Ecuador is fannyi while, as is apparently the case, in Colombia, the
form of the Subtropical Zone is verticeps.

Two ‘ Bogota’ males of this species are interesting. They have the short
tail and green back of verticeps, but the interscapular band is purple as in
fannyi. ,

Zone. Specimens from the Pacific coast differ from those from the Mag-
dalena Valley (which may be considered essentially topotypical), in having
less bronze in the tail and the underparts bluer green. They thus approach

toward C. isaure; of which we have a large series from eastern Panama
(21) the latter appears to be the Panama representative of the Colombian

Found by us only in open places in the Subtropical Zone. With the
exception of a male from Cerro Munchique, all our specimens are from the
Central Andes. The presence or absence of a violet or purple tinge on the
abdomen, appears to be individual and is possibly due to age. The under
tail-coverts, in our series, average more buffy than in a series from Merida,
Venezuela. However, in some Colombian specimens the buff is reduced to a
minimum, while, on the other hand, the specimen which has the buffiest
under tail-coverts can be essentially matched by a Merida specimen. I can-
not feel, therefore, that, so far as our series is concerned, this character is of
diagnostic value. I am unable to appreciate the validity of the characters
assigned to the Costa Rican bird “ Petasophora cabanidis Heine” and thus
agree with Ridgway (Bull. U. S. N. M., 50, p. 484).

Specimens from the Subtropical Zone of the Western Andes, and western
slope of the Central Andes, while obviously to be referred to equatorialis
show, in some instances, characters which indicate the intergradation of
this form with true rubinoides. Thus, three adult males from San Antonio,
have the forehead narrowly glittering green of the same color as in rubi-
notdes, and in one of these birds this color extends backward on the center
of the crown as a fairly well-defined stripe. In the length of the bill the west
Colombian examples agree with Ecuador specimens. Three females, two of
which had the ovaries slightly enlarged, have a fairly well-developed throat-
patch.

and a male from Caracas. The bill in the Bogoté form, for which Berlepsch
proposed the name parvula (J. c.) is said by Hartert to measure 18-19 rarely
20 mm., whereas in five males from the Bogoté region, selected at random,
it measures 21-22 mm., the dimensions accredited to typical leadbeater?.

So far as my material goes, therefore, it gives no reason for the recognition
of a Bogoté form. A female from La Frijolera, on the western slope of the
Central Andes, near the northern limit of the range, is decidedly greener, less
bronzy than others from La Candela. The culmen measures 22 mm.

Seventeen topotypical specimens from the Andes west of Popayan are
intermediate between ‘Bogota’ birds and Ecuadorian specimens (B. f.
tinochlora Oberh.). They are, however, nearer to Bogoté birds, in which the
greenish tip to the outer tail-feathers is reduced to the minimum, than they
are to tinochlora. In other words, as with Phaiolaima rubinoides, West
Andean birds, evidently by pure parallelism, have departed from the
Ecuadorian type much as have the birds of the Eastern Andes, but in the
Western Andes the differentiation has not yet been carried so far as it has
in the Eastern Andes.

(1289a) Vestipedes paramillo sp. nov.

Char. sp.— Most nearly related to Vestipedes vestitus smaragdinipectus (Gould),
but male with the purple throat-patch smaller, triangular in shape, as in Vestipedes
nigrivestris, and entirely surrounded by glittering emerald-green; upperparts greener,
less coppery, more uniform; rump slightly bluer; female greener, less coppery,
throat-patch smaller and bluer, area about it greener; size smaller.

Type.— No. 133144, Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., @ ad., Paramillo, 12500 ft., W. Andes,
Col., Jan. 29, 1915; Miller & Boyle.

Range. Known only from the Paramo Zone at the northern end of the Western
Andes of Colombia.

Description of Male— Upperparts anteriorly uniform grass-green, becoming
slightly bluer on the rump and vivid, glittering metallic brassy green on the upper
tail-coverts; tail forked, uniform bluish black; wings purplish black, their lesser
coverts green of the same color as the back; the greater coverts purplish black exter-
nally, tinged with green; lower wing-coverts washed with green; throat with a bluish-
violet triangular patch, its apex reaching to the chin which, with the entire malar
region and breast is, at the best angle of reflection, glittering metallic emerald-
green; remainder of the underparts green of essentially the same color as the back,

. through which the blackish bases of the feathers appear to a greater or less extent;
flanks fluffy, snowy white; under tail-coverts metallic purple of the same color as
the throat; feet and bill black. Average of five specimens: Wing, 56.6; tail, 39.5;
bill, 17.5 mm.

Description of Female — Upperparts as in the male but more bronzy, the glittering
upper tail-covert area somewhat less pronounced; the throat-patch more graduate,
or circular, peacock-blue with grayish bases of the feathers showing through; sur-
rounding green area decidedly more bronzy and Jess uniform on the chin, and more
or less buffy basally; a buffy loral streak; remaining underparts of a paler green,
more or less mixed with grayish, especially medianly; lower tail-coverts blue and with
more grayish. Average of five specimens: Wing, 57; tail, 38.6; bill, 18.7 mm.

Remarks.— This species, which is based on seven males and six females,
all from the type-locality, is an obvious representative of Vestipedes vestitus,
but its differently shaped throat-patch and glittering green malar areas are
more than differences of degree and, in my opinion, are of specific value.

The restricted area occupied by the Paramo Zone iti the Western Andes,
and the isolation of these areas from those occupied by the same zone in the
Central Andes, prevent the range of this species from coming into contact
with that of its nearest ally.

A common species in the Subtropical Zone of the Western Andes, and

its validity. In both sexes the abdomen is more extensively. white than in
aurelia, and the anterior underparts are margined with whitish instead of
buffy. In the female, the tawny tinge on the white tibial tuft, present in
aurelie, is wholly lacking in all but one of our specimens of caucensis.

series from Ecuador, shows that all our birds should be referred to the form

described by Hartert, which differs from derbyi only in its longer bill. The
comparative rarity of this long-billed race in Bogoté collections, the absence
of definite records of it from the Ecuadorian Andes, and the fact that it is
common at the northern end of the Central Andes, where true derbyi might
be expected to occur, indicate in my opinion, that this species does not
occur in the Eastern Andes and that Bogoté skins of it come from the
Central Andes, probably from the Quindio trail region where our specimens
were taken. .

The culmen in five males measures 21.0 mm.; in five females, it measures
22.1 mm.

race can be distinguished from melanthera only by their longer tails and
larger terminal spatules. Bogoté females average less spotted below than
those from Ecuador, but on the other hand, Cauca females, which approxi-
mately agree with those from the Bogoté region in size, are no more spotted
below than those from Ecuador. The tail increases in length as one advances
northward, ranging from 68 mm. in the Quito region, to 73 mm. at San
Antonio, and 82 mm. at Salento and the Bogoté region.

Heliangelus exortis soderstromi QBERH., Proc. U. 8S. N. M., 1902, p. 334 (female).

Common in all three ranges. In the Western and Central Andes it is
restricted largely to the Temperate Zone, but in the Eastern Andes it occurs
chiefly in the Subtropical Zone — an unusual case in distribution. Males
from the three ranges agree in color. Those from the Central and Western
Andes agree in size, but in three specimens from the Western Andes the tail
appears to average shorter; but since our specimens from this region are in
molt, measurements taken from them are not satisfactory. '

Seven of eight immature females from the Central Andes have the white
throat-patch thickly spotted with blackish, while five of six immature
females from the Eastern Andes have this patch white without spots, and
in the sixth there are but a few spots near the breast. Nine specimens col-
lected by us, and sexed as females, have a throat-patch superficially resem-
bling that of the male in color, but somewhat smaller and less solid, the
feathers usually being whitish rather than grayish basally.
1917,] Chapman, Distribution of Bird-life in Colombia. 305

The correct sexing of these specimens is indicated by their small size and
by the collector’s comments on the condition of the sexual organs which
were in one case much enlarged. These specimens have somewhat more
brownish on the abdomen than adult males and are more bronzy above.

The type of Heliangelus exortis soderstromi Oberh. (Proc. U. S. N. M.,
1902, p. 384), from western Ecuador, can be closely matched by these
undoubted Colombian females, and although it is sexed “7,” and was
‘collected’ by Goodfellow and Hamilton, the skin resembles a native-made
skin and is in my opinion that of a female. If this be true, the characters
attributed to H. e. soderstromi are sexual, not racial.

Andes, which it evidently represents, but has the elongated feathers of the
crown more tawny, the underparts generally more rufescent, outer web
(except at the base), tip, shaft, and a narrow strip along the shaft on the inner
web of the outer tail-feather ochraceous-buff; an ochraceous-buff shaft-
streak on the remaining tail-feathers. The metallic throat-plumes are in
molt, but it is apparent that those of the chin would have been green, while
the longer plumes would have been orange-purple.

Inhabits the Subtropical Zone of the Eastern Andes in the Bogoté
region and northward at least to Bucaramanga.

The distribution of the forms of the genus Cyanolesbia in Colombia and
the characters they exhibit, present a problem in regard to their relation-
ships which I confess I am unable satisfactorily to solve. All are confined
to the Subtropical Zone, and the occurrence of the green-throated C. emme
and the purple-throated C. celestis in this zone, in the Western Andes, in
one instance at localities practically within sight of each other, is evidence
of the specific distinctness of these forms. At no other place, it must be
stated, have we found the green and the blue-throated forms so nearly
associated; but on the other hand, our large series of males do not show one
intermediate specimen. Thus not one of thirteen males of emme from
western Colombia, and twenty-six males of caudata from Merida, shows
any trace of a purple throat-patch. With equal truth it may be said that
twenty-two males of C. mocoa, eight of celestis, five of kingi, and two of
margarethe, all possess the purple throat-patch.!

 

1 Hartert, in his first review (Nov. Zool., I, 1894, p. 47) of this genus reached conclusions in regard
to the relationships of ite forms essentially similar to those I here present; but subsequently (Nov.
Zool., V, 1898, p. 514) he treated them all, except berlepschi and celestis, as subspecies. Lack of proper
data accompanying his species prevented Hartert in some instances from giving correct ranges. For
the same reason his remarks in regard to specimens of emmz with “blue” on the throat lose point
since it is not impossible that these birds came from the range of mocoa and hence should be referred
to that species.

Of caudata he states that not one among about one hundred adult males from Merida showed
“even an indication of a blue spot on the throat,"’ Nevertheless, he treats this bird as a subspecies
of kingif! ©
308 Bulletin American Museum of Natural History. (Vol. XXXVI,

This constancy of marking, and the fact that in at least one range of the
Andes, the green-throated and purple-throated forms occupy the same zone,
lead me to believe that we have here two distinct species both of which pre-
sent somewhat similar subspecific variations.

Cyanolesbia berlepschi from northeastern Venezuela I have not seen.
Its description Hartert (Bull. B. O. C., VIII, 1898, p. XVI) shows that the
male closely resembles the male of kingi, but the female differs from that
of any known species in having the abdomen wholly white. It is, therefore,
nearer to the female of celestis in which the breast is white, than to that of
the remaining species of the group.

All of these are well represented in our collections, and a study of their
variations in connection with the information we have gathered concern-
ing the faunal affinities of the regions they inhabit, leads me to group them
as below:

Key to Males.

Throat green
Tail green C. emme
(Western and Central Andes, Col.).
Tail blue C. caudata
(Western Andes, Ven.)
Throat purple or bluish
Tail green
Throat purple C. mocoa mocoa
(Andes at head of Magdalena Valley southward in Eastern Andes to Ecuador).
Throat bluish C. mocoa smaragdina
(Bolivia; Peru).
Tail blue
Underparts green
Upperparts darker green C. hingi kingt
(Eastern Andes — Bogoté Region, Col.)
Upperparts lighter green C. kingi margarethe
(Caracas region, Ven.).
Underparts coppery C. colesiis

(Western Andes of Colombia and Ecuador).

I observe no evidence of the intergradation of kingi with mocoa as is °
stated more fully under that species; but margarethe of the mountains about
Caracas is an obvious racial representative of the Bogoté form from which it
differs but slightly.

Whether the ranges of margarethe and kingi are actually separated by a
region (Merida) in which the green-throated caudata alone occurs is not
known.

range appears to coincide with that of C. celestis. We have specimens of
emme from Gallera and of celestis from the nearby Cerro Munchique.

Our large series of emme shows little individual variation and no indi-
cation of intergradation with other forms. In the Merida region emme
is represented by C. caudata from which, however, it appears to be specifically
distinct.

Andes, arising from the upper Magdalena Valley and southward along the'
Eastern Andes through Ecuador probably to northern Peru.

The localities at which our twenty-three specimens of this bird were
taken have a close faunal affinity, indeed almost identity, with the region in
the same zone about the city of Bogoté (Fusugasugé; El Roble, etc.).
Nevertheless our specimens indicate that mocoa and kingi do not intergrade.

Specimens from “Ambato” (=e. Ecuador) are referable to mocoa.

In Colombia this bird appears to be restricted to the Tropical Zone of
the Pacific coast, and humid lower Cauca-Magdalena region whence it
ranges southward to western Ecuador and northward to Guatemala. The
type-locality is obviously incorrect. Doubtless the type came through
Carthagena from the humid region south of that port.

Appears to be restricted to the Pacific coast where it ranges from sea-

find is in Hidalgo, Mexico. If there be no other, Bourcier’s type-locality
is evidently incorrect. ,

Ornismya heliodor Bourc., Rev. Zool., 1840, p. 275 (Bogoté).

I am unable to discover any constant difference either in form or color
between topotypical females of Chetocercus heliodor and C. bombus. Wholly
on geographical grounds, therefore, [ refer a female from San Agustin to the
former. A female from Miraflores on the western slope of the Central
Andes, cannot, however, be disposed of so satisfactorily, since the locality
has faunal affinities with both Ecuador and the Eastern Andes. Under the
circumstances, I can see no valid reason for the generic separation of C.
bombus (see Oberholser, Proc. U. S. N. M., 1902, p. 341, remarks under
“ Polyzemus bombus’’) since the characters ascribed to it are sexual rather
than generic.

This species occupies chiefly the Subtropical Zone of all three ranges. .
My single Peruvian specimen, a female from Inca Mine, has the wing-coverts
vermiculated with brown and blackish and may therefore be considered as
representing this species. Colombian females essentially agree with it but
have the outer tail-feathers less broadly tipped with white. I have no
males from Peru but our Colombian males agree with three figures in Gould’s
Monograph (2d ed.) which are said to represent the type.

(14572) Trogonurus assimilis (Gould).
Trogon assimilis Goutp, P. Z. §., 1846, p. 67 (Peru).

Inhabits the Temperate Zone in the Western, Central and Eastern Andes,
where it appears to be a zonal representative of T. personatus of the Sub-
tropical Zone. Eleven males differ from a large Colombian series of per-
sonatus chiefly in the much less pronounced, more broken and, in some cases,
almost obsolete white bars on the three outer pairs of rectrices and in having
bluer reflections on anterior parts of the crown and breast, and a smaller
bill. In the markings of the tail they thus seem to agree with Gould’s
description of assimilis. Seven females, however, differ from Gould’s
description of the female of assimilis, and in a like manner from the female
of personatus, in having the wing nearly similar in color as well as in markings
to that of the male. The lesser coverts are tinged with brown, but the re-
maining coverts and exposed portions of the inner wing-quills are minutely
marked with blackish and white, exactly as they are in the male, and all but
the three outer quills are conspicuously.white at the base. Except in hav-
ing somewhat less white. in the tail and a smaller bill, these birds in other
respects agree with the female of personatus. One of our specimens has the
ovaries considerably enlarged. There can, therefore, be no question of its
sex.

In the absence of specimens from Peru I provisionally accept Gould’s
name for the species. It is true that he described the female of assimilis
as having the “coverts and secondaries freckled with yellowish brown in-
stead of gray’’, but it is not improbable that in the absence of exact data, or
none at all, he-may have had in hand a female of personatus. :

Char. subsp.— Male most nearly resembling 7. curucuit curueui but exposed
upper portions of six inner tail-feathers rich copper-bronze (as in T. ambiguus), in
some specimens with, in others without, greenish reflections; bars of three outer

_ pairs of tail-feathers wider, as in J. c. tenellus; wing-coverts more broadly barred;
no white evident at the junction of green breast with orange abdomen; resembles
T. c. tenellus in the barring of the outer tail-feathers and wing-coverts, but differs in
its copper-bronze tail, absence of white pectoral band, and more deeply colored
abdominal region.

Female most like 7. ¢. curucué but. wing-coverts apparently more widely barred;
the abdomen more deeply colored than in T. ¢. tenellus, the wing-coverts more broadly
barred, the breast, at junction of brown and orange, without, or with but a slight
indication of the conspicuous white or grayish pectoral band.

A Tropical Zone species which extends from the Pacific Coast eastward
through the humid lower Cauca and Magdalena Valleys.

Jam in doubt as to the identity of an adult male from La Morelia in the
Caqueté region. It has the tail more coppery than in the most extreme
specimen of cupreicauda, there is a more evident white pectoral band, and
the wing-coverts are less broadly barred, but in other respects it agrees with
the Pacific coast bird. :

(1467) Trogonurus bolivianus (Grané).

Trogon bolivianus Grant, Cat. Bds. B. M. XVII, 1890, p. 470, pl. xv, (Cosni-
pata, Peru).

Two males and a female from the Caqueté region should apparently be
referred to this species. They agree with an “Ecuador” specimen and dif-
fer from a male from the lower Beni in Bolivia only in the practical absence
of the white pectoral zone. Hellmayr (Nov. Zool., XV, 1908, p. 88) sug-
gests that bolivianus is a synonym of behni Gould. Grant, however, lists
Gould’s type under Trogon variegatus and examination of Gould’s figure and
description (Mon. Trog. 2nd Ed. 1875, pl. 20) confirms this view of its rela-
tionships. In spite of the fact, therefore, that the type of bekni is said to
have come from Bolivia and that our specimens from the Lower Beni agree
closely with others from Napo and southeastern Colombia, I accept Grant’s
name for the more western bird. Four males (one each from La Morelia,
near Florencia, “ Ecuador,” and the Lower Beni) differ from nine others from
Chapada, Matto Grosso, which I assume to be variegatus, in having the back
much greener, less bronzy, the breast bluer, the white pectoral zone less
pronounced or absent, the white bars in the tail narrower and black ones
correspondingly wider. A female from the lower Beni has an indication of
the white pectoral zone, but it is by no means so pronounced as in a Chapada
female. The white in the tail of the Beni specimen is practically confined
to the outer margins of the three outer feathers, except for a very narrow
tip, whereas in the Chapada bird it extends to the inner web and the tip is
much broader. A female from La Morelia has no white in the breast and
even less in the tail than the Beni bird. Doubtless the latter to some extent
approaches variegatus but so far as the present material goes it is unques-
tionably referable to bolivianus.

A single specimen in juvenal plumage taken at San Antonio, January 12,
indicates, in connection with Hellmayr’s record from the Rio Sipi, that this
species ranges from sea-level to at least 6600 feet.

Three adults from Barbacoas are somewhat darker, and less rufescent
than the type and two other specimens from Panama. Possibly the dif-
ference may be due to the greater age of the Panama skins.

Neocrex uniformis Hart., Nov. Zool., 1901, p. 369 (Pambilar, 8. Javier, Ec.).

Bangs finds on comparison no difference between a specimen from San
Antonio and the type of this species, and hence concludes that uniformis
Hart. is a synonym. I therefore refer our three specimens from Barbacoas
to this species.

?Gallinula galeata Scu. & Sarv., P. Z. §., 1879, p. 546 (Antioquia; breeding).

Abundant in the Cauca Valley, where we took specimens in December,
May and August. Lacking typical specimens of G. c. galeata for compari-
son, I accept Mr. Bangs’ proposed form from the Cauca Valley, which is
said to differ from galeata only in smaller size. I agree with Bangs, Hartert
and Rothschild (Bangs, /. c.) that the relationships of Old and New World
Gallinules are best expressed by treating them as subspecifically related.

Porphyriops melanops bogotensis Cuapm., Bull. A. M. N. H., XX XIII, 1914,

Char. subsp.— Similar to P. m. melanops but axillars not barred, the upperparts
darker, the interscapulars in the adult largely chestnut, like the wing-coverts.

This rail-like Gallinule is common on the reed-grown sloughs of the
Bogot4 Savanna. It is the most northern representative of a species which
inhabits the Temperate Zone at sea-level in Argentina and Chile.

(265a) Fulica americana columbiana Chapm.

Fulica americana columbiana Cuapm., Bull. A. M. N. H., XXXIH, 1914, p. 170
(La Herrera, Bogoté Savanna, Col.).

Char. subsp.— Similar to F. a. americana, but tarsi and toes longer, bill heavier
and longer, frontal shield larger, higher, rounded posteriorly and more clearly defined
from the bill anteriorly; bill basally, in breeding specimens, yellowish; plumage,
particularly of the underparts, darker, more slaty; the under wing-coverts darker
with little or no white edgings; the white at the ends of the inner secondaries averag-
ing less in extent and confined largely to the inner web of the feathers.

A locally common bird in the sloughs of the Bogot& Savanna. Doubt-
less this form is deserving of specific distinction, but its relationships seem
best expressed by a trinomial designation. It is remarkable that while in
South America as in North America Fulica appears to be a Temperate Zone
hird, a nearly allied race of americana should be found at sea-level in the
West Indies. :

A pair of birds (of which the female was laying) taken at Cali, May 10,
agree in size with North American examples but are much more fuscous
above, and grayer below. The difference in the underparts resembles that
which exists between Colymbus d. brachypterus and C. d. brachyrhynchus,
and is apparently not due to seasonal variation or wear. The Cauca birds
doubtless represent a resident race. They measure, male (Fuertes Coll.),

I provisionally refer to this species a young female in broadly barred

Santa Marta specimen has the upperparts more broadly barred with rusty
of a deeper shade, and the longer under wing-coverts are fuscous distinctly
barred and tipped with white, while in the Salento specimen they are fus-
cous; the bars are broken or appear as a spot, and the white tip is more in
the nature of a rounded, terminal band. I do not know that these varia-
tions in color have any significance, nor am I aware that thd differences, if
any, between lineatum and salmoni at this age have been pointed out.

A male from Juntas de Taman, is dark olive-green narrowly barred
with rusty above, a plumage which seems to follow that of the young bird
just mentioned, and which is apparently the one referred to in the British
Museum Catalogue (XXXI,p. 198). The bill-measures 88 mm., the longer
under wing-coverts are fuscous, unbarred, and narrowly margined with
white.

The bill in salmoni (of which we have three essentially adult specimens)
is not only shorter than in linéatum but is proportionately heavier and less
pointed, while the mandible is sharply bicolor, the basal half being (in skins)
largely yellowish horn (except along the tomium), the terminal half blackish,
except along the gonys on which the color of the base éxtends. This char-
acter is well shown by the second specimen in intermediate plumage, men-
tioned above, but not by the black and buff barred young.

Char. subsp.— Similar to J. e. exilis but slightly smaller; adult male in breeding
plumage with the underparts more richly colored; the breast, abdomen, flanks,
under wing and under tail-coverts warm buff, the thighs deeper in tone; the median
and lesser wing-coverts richer, mainly ochraceous-buff more or less margined with
tawny-russet; adult female more nearly resembling adult female of J. e. exilis but the
abdominal region, flanks, thighs, under wing and under tail-coverts deeper, warm
buff; the back slightly darker; immature male much richer in color than I. e. exilis
of same age; underparts heavily washed with ochraceous-buff; central wing-covert
area ochraceous-tawny; in adult and immature, tarsi black, toes brownish, their
soles yellow.

Izobrychus exilis is apparently a rare bird in South America. It is not
included in Brabourne and Chubb’s ‘The Birds of South America’ (1912),
but is stated in the A. O. U. ‘Check-List’ (1910), to occur as far south as
Brazil. The discovery of a local race of this boreal species on the Bogotd
Savanna is therefore a fact of rather exceptional interest. An apparently
mated pair, both having the sexual organs enlarged, was taken on February
17, and an immature male, taken January 21, was purchased by Mr. Fuertes
from a local collector. Doubtless the bird is not uncommon in the reedy
marshes of the Savanna, but strangely enough it appears not before to have
been recorded from the Bogota region.

Fuligula nationi Scu. & Satv., P. Z.S., 1877, p. 522 (Lima, Peru).

‘This duck, of which the two specimens in the British Museum appear to
be the only ones hitherto in collections, proves to be a common species in
the marshes of the Cauca Valley near Cali, where six males and eight fe-
males were secured in January, February and May. Doubtless it is a per-
manent resident.

This fine series together with Wied’s types of “ Anas erythropthalma”’
and five specimens! of the South African M. brunnea, enable me satisfac-
torily to determine the inter-relationships of these interesting birds (¢f.
Cat. Bds. B. M., XXVII, p. 353).

Although Wied’s types, collected at Lagoa do Braco, near Villa de Bel-
monte in 1815-17 were mounted and are somewhat faded through exposure
to light, they are evidently specifically identical with “ Nyroca brunnea”
Eyton (1838) which is therefore a pure synonym of “ Anas erythropthalma”
(Wied). -

The Brazilian birds, in spite of their long exposure to light, differ re-
markably little from recently collected African skins, while the male type
agrees minutely with a mounted African specimen which has been on ex-
hibition for over thirty years. The female type is more rusty below than
African females, a difference apparently due to that type of rusty coloration
which is frequently found in the Anatide.

With but two specimens at his disposal, Salvadori (J. c.) was uncertain
whether or not nationt was separable from brunnea (= erythropthalma).

‘The material at hand, however, leaves no doubt of their specific distinct-
ness, although nationi appears to be a Pacific coast representative of ery-
thropthalma. . Although the pattern of coloration is the same in both species,
the male of nationz is so much darker than the male of erythropthalma that
less contrast exists between the colors of adjacent areas, notably the sides
of the head, the crown and nape, and the pattern is therefore less marked.

In nationi the crown and nape are rich, purplish black and this color
spreads over the sides of the head and throat where, however, close inspec-
tion reveals a rufous shade on the region which, in erythrepthalma, is strongly
rufous-chestnut with but a slight purplish tinge chiefly along the line of -
junction with the clearly defined glossy seal-brown crown and nape. The
male of nationt further differs conspicuously from the corresponding sex of
erythropthalma in having the breast and neck all around glossy black, the
back much darker, though similarly vermiculated, the belly dull grayish
black, and the flanks deeper chestnut.

The females of the two species, as might be expected, present less strik-
ing differences than those exhibited by the males, although they are of much
the same nature, being occasioned by the darker color throughout of nation?.
‘This greater intensity of color is most apparent in the increased richness of
the rufous markings which in nationi approach a chestnut rather than fer-
Tuginous color, as in erythropthalma. The two species, however, are sur-
prisingly alike and it is conceivable that in certain conditions of plumage it
might be impossible to distinguish between them.

Found by us only in the Central Andes where it is not uncommon on
the rapid rivers of the Subtropical Zone. Our four specimens are males, one
being adult, the others immature with the underparts white, unmarked ex-
cept for the bars on the sides and flanks. The male, taken in the Rio Toché,
October 23, had the testes much enlarged, and is just completing a molt in ~
which the tail was renewed, indicating the near approach of the nesting
season.

Two of the immature birds, taken at Salento, Sept. 25, are acquiring
new wing-quills but the rectrices are very worn and the shafts of the six
central feathers are projected 30-34 mm. beyond the vanes of the feather
proper. The basal half of this projection is devoid of barbs, while the api-
cal half is finely set with barbs about 2 mm. in length. In the third imma-
ture bird, taken at El] Eden, Nov. 13, the remiges are fully grown and these
peculiar projections are wanting on the much worn tail-feathers. Possibly
they represent a preceding plumage and disappear by breaking off. The
point at which the break is to occur is indicated by a transparent space just
beyond the vane of the feather. If, as seems probable, these rather stiffly
barbed, projecting shafts constitute the rectrices of the natal down, they
are doubtless of assistance to the young bird in clambering up on the water-
washed rocks which form its natural resting-places.

(584) Circus buffoni (Gmel.).
Falco buffonit Gurt., Syst. Nat., I, 1788, p. 277 (Cayenne).

I provisionally refer to this species, which has not before been recorded
from Colombia, two harriers from Rio Frio which resemble one another in
color and differ from all descriptions, plates, and specimens of Circus buffoni
which I have examined, in being black below as well as above. In the color
of the upperparts, wings, tail and white facial markings these birds are not
unlike two male specimens from Buenos Aires, but the latter have the upper
tail-coverts white barred with grayish black, while the breast is black tinged
with rusty and with more or less concealed white bars or spots. The lower
abdomen, thighs and under tail-coverts are rusty chestnut, the two former
narrowly barred or tipped, the latter widely barred with white and with
some trace of black. The Rio Frio birds, on the other hand, have the upper
tail-coverts black with narrow, usually imperfect white bars, while the en-
tire underparts, thighs and under tail-coverts are black with a faint trace
of rusty on the thighs, lower abdomen and under tail-coverts, and in the
latter a single white spotted feather.

Whether these birds represent a melanistic phase or undescribed form
of Circus buffoni the material at hand unfortunately does not show. They
agree approximately in size with an unsexed, apparently adult, Guiana
specimen which resembles Lesson’s plate in being white below,! but are con-
siderably smaller than the Buenos Aires birds, as is evident from the
appended measurements:

I follow Hellmayr in referring Chocé specimens to this form. Adult
males from Las Lomitas and San Antonio agree essentially with them. A
Névita bird has the plumbeous of the back and wings with a brownish tinge
and the underparts are more coarsely barred and washed with buffy, dif-
ferences which probably indicate immaturity. San José, Dabeiba and
Salencio immature males have the upperparts light clove-brown, the under-
parts unbarred and with the nuchal collar ochraceous-buff. The flanks of
one bird and the thighs of the other have one or two black and white barred
feathers, indicating that the succeeding plumage would be that of the plum-
beous adult.

/ An immature Salento bird is slaty black above, cream-buff with narrow

but well-defined black bars below, and the nuchal collar is white. A grow-
ing feather on the breast is white finely barred with black, similar to that
of the adult, indicating that this plumage also would be followed by that
of the plumbeous adult. Possibly this Salento specimen should be referred
to M. g. zonothorax.

The distribution of this Hawk in Colombia is most puzzling. It occurs
in both the Tropical and Subtropical Zones and occupies'all the region east
of the Central Andes and north of the Cauca Valley, and it is also found on
the Pacific coast and southward along the Pacific coast of Ecuador. In -
general it may be said that in Colombia the range of magnirostris surrounds
that of those representatives of ruficauda which inhabit the Cauca Valley
and slopes arising from it.

_ All the Colombian specimens listed below (except one from Barbacoas)
including two from the Atrato Valley, are essentially typical of magniros-
frig in color, though those from west of the Eastern Andes are somewhat
smaller than those from the region about Villavicencio; but a bird from
Barbacoas and eight from western Ecuador. show some slight approach
toward ruficauda. The white bars below perhaps average wider and the
bars on the thighs may average somewhat more rufous; the tail shows the
slightest trace of tawny confined as a rule to the outer pair of feathers; the
under wing-coverts are white barred with brownish or black; the upper tail-
coverts are white, in two specimens with a faint buff tint and barred with
blackish. Further material and finer discrimination may show that these
birds are distinguishable from true magnirostris with which they appear to
have no geographic connection; but there can be no doubt that they are
referable to that form rather than to ruficauda.

In addition to the specimens from western Colombia listed below, we
have. Ecuador specimens from Esmeraldas (4), Santa Rosa (1), Naranjo,
Prov. Guayas (2), and Daule (1). The specimens from the Atrato and
Dabeiba are essentially typical magnirostris as that species is represented
by an excellent series from eastern Colombia and Venezuela. The presence
of this form on the Pacific coast is doubtless due to its extension westward
from northern Colombia where, as we have seen, magnirostris occurs.

Inosculation of these forms is indicated by the capture of a specimen at
Noanamé which is obviously nearer to ruficauda than to magnirostris; but
this makes it difficult to explain the reappearance of magnirostris in Ecuador.

The further interesting distribution of this species in Colombia is treated
under the next form.

The problem presented by our large series of Rupornis magnirostris is
so puzzling that I have assembled a large series of the northern forms of this
species in order to determine its range of individual and geographic variation.

Primarily, it was essential to ascertain what were the characteristics of
R. m. ruficauda and to what area this race was restricted. In describing it,
Sclater gave no definite type-locality and although the first place named
under the “Habitat” assigned to the new form is Cordova, Mexico, it is
evident from his description and subsequent figure in Exotic Ornithology
(pl. 88) that among his specimens the characters on which he based the form
were typically developed only in those from western Panama, whence I
have a series of eleven specimens. From the localities named by Sclater I
therefore suggest David, as an appropriate type-locality for this form.

If this suggestion be accepted, our specimens from Boqueron, near David,
are essentially topotypical. All have the interspaces in the rectrices largely
or wholly rich tawny or reddish brown, and in the adult, the back and breast
are mouse-gray, much as they are in true magnirostris. :

Aside from its reddish tail, ruficauda differs from magnirostris in its
buffy or ochraceous underparts, under wing-coverts and upper tail-coverts,
the bars on which are much brighter, more tawny than in magnirostris.

Whether all western Panama specimens have the tail as fully reddish
brown as in those I have examined cannot be stated. Of five specimens
from the Canal Zone three are essentially like those from Boqueron, two
have much more gray in the tail which, however, still shows more or less
tawny. Two specimens, one each from Coiba and Iguaro Islands, have
the interspaces wholly tawny. A male from Marraganti, 150’ miles east of
Panama City has about as much gray and tawny in the tail as the two Zone
specimens above mentioned, with which, in other respects it also agrees.
Although these three birds have not the wholly tawny and black tail of
Boqueron specimens, they agree with them in possessing the other char-
- acters which distinguish typical ruficauda; that is, a back and breast which
are essentially like those of magnirostris, in combination with buffy or
ochracegus underparts, etc. barred with reddish brown. /

Turning now to the west, a fine series of seventeen specimens from Costa
Rica makes it possible to learn with some certainty the relationships of the
form inhabiting that country. In only three does the amount of red in the
tail compare with that shown by the Boqueron specimens. The back and
breast average less gray and the latter is more streaked. There is thus an
advance toward griseocauda; but Costa Rica birds are obviously much
nearer ruficauda.

Beyond Costa Rica, however, while specimens with more or less tawny
_ in the tail are not infrequent (even southern Mexico birds sometimes show
246 Bulletin American Museum of Natural History. [Vol. XXXVI,

this feature) the increasing brownness of the back and breast and of stripes
in the latter would incline me to extend the range of griseocauda southward
through the greater part of Nicaragua.

With the full development of the characters which constitute griseocauda,
it is interesting to observe that we have in Mexico a race of magnirostris
which more closely resembles R. m. natterert of southern Brazil than it does
any of the geographically intervening races.

The excellence of my material has induced me to depart for a moment
from the consideration of our Colombian specimens, to which, having now
determined the features which distinguish ruficauda and magnirostris, we
may return.

As has been stated under that form, magnirostris occupies the greater
part of Colombia, even occurring on the Pacific Coast. We have, however,
sixteen specimens from the Cauca Valley region which are obviously refer-
able to ruficauda rather than to magnirostris. None are without at least
a trace of tawny in the tail. In some it. is reduced to a minimum, in others
it covers most of the interspaces. The color of upper tail-coverts and under
wing-coverts is, on the whole intermediate; but the buffy color and bright
tawny bars of the abdominal region and thighs is clearly that of ruficauda.

Five specimens from Salento are nearest magnirostris. One of these
might be considered typical of that form were it not for a trace of tawny
on the outer pair of rectrices.

The capture of a specimen, which I refer to ruficauda, at Noanamé re-
quires comment since a specimen from the Atrato, north of Noanamé, is
wholly typical of magnirosiris.

So far as tail markings are concerned this bird, which is in fresh adult
plumage, is nearer magnirostris, the outer feathers only showing a trace of
tawny, but its deep buffy tawny barred belly, thighs, and under wing-coverts
are those of ruficauda while the upper tail-coverts are more like those of. .
ruficauda than of magnirostris.

The presence of this form at Noanamé I take to represent the south-
ward extension of ruficauda along the Pacific coast lowlands, whence its
occurrence at Las Lomitas indicates that it has reached the Cauca Valley
by crossing the Western Andes. The bird of western Ecuador which I refer
to magnirostris, nay have reached that region directly from the east, as have
many other Amazonian forms:

The Sparrowhawk ranges from the Tropical to the Temperate Zone,

but although it varies widely faunally, not less than four forms being found
in Colombia, it appears not to vary zonally in that country.

Thus the present form ranges from the llanos of eastern Colombia over
the Eastern Andes to the Magdalena Valley and the eastern slopes of the
Central Andes. Northward it enters into Antioquia but in the Paramo of
Tamé, on the Venezuela boundary, it is replaced by C. s. ochkracea Cory
(Pub. 182 Field Mus. 1915, p. 298) which, as Cory has shown, is distinguished
by the greater width of the subterminal tail-band. In the Cauca Valley it
is replaced by C. s. cauce, and in the arid north coastal region by a pale form
of C. s. ochracea.

A pair of Sparrowhawks taken at Turbaco, near Carthagena, in the arid
coastal. zone, apparently represents a pale form of C.s. ochracea Cory. The
subterminal band in the central rectrix of the male measures 32 mm. and in
this respect the bird resembles ochracea, but the general coloration is more.
like that of zsabellina. A male from San Antonio, Bermudez, on the coast
of Venezuela, closely resembles the Turbaco male, but is somewhat deeper
in color both above and below. The subterminal band in the central rec-
trix measures 30 mm. The Turbaco female is relatively as pale as the male
and has an exceptionally small amount of cinnamon in the white areas on
the wing-quills. A female from Noanamé in worn plumage may be most
closely related to this Caribbean coast form which I hesitate to characterize
by name on the basis of the material at hand.

(721) Glaucidium brasilianum phalenoides. (Daud.).
Strix phalenoides Daup., Traité, 11, 1800, p. 206 (Trinidad).

A specimen from La Playa, near Barranquilla, is matched by one of
seven specimens from Bonda, near Santa Marta, and the series of eight
birds, containing as it does examples in both rufous and gray and inter-
mediate plumages, doubtless fairly well represents the form of this Ow] oc-
cupying northern Colombia. As a whole these birds are lighter than
phalenoides, of which I have six specimens from Trinidad, and darker than
ridgwayt, of which we have a large series from Mexico. A specimen in the
red phase resembles one in this phase from Costa Rica, but those in the
gray or grayish phase have the tail barred with blackish and white, while in
all our specimens of ridgwayt the tail is more rufous. In this respect the
Colombian specimens are much nearer phalenoides. I therefore refer
them to that race, in the belief that there is little or nothing to be gained
in proposing forms where geographic variation is so slight, and individual
Variation so great that subsequent identification, except at type-localities,
becomes largely a matter of opinion.' In view of its diurnal habits and fre-
quently uttered call, the Pygmy Owl is easily observed and collected, and
our failure to secure it elsewhere in Colombia than at the localities above
mentioned, is negative evidence of some value.

This Paroquet appears to be known only from the arid Caribbean por-
tion of the Tropical Zone of Colombia. In addition to the specimens listed
below, we have also one labelled “Santa Marta” and the range of the species
may extend eastward into Venezuela. Farther east it is represented by
C. chrysophrys Swains (= e@ruginosus Auct.), and to the west by C. ocularis.

.The name @ruginosus (Linn.) as currently used, is applied to two quite
different. birds, one of which has a more or less complete and conspicuous
ring of orange feathers about the orbital region, while in the other this mark
is usually absent, though in some specimens there are a few yellow feathers
in. this area, particularly below the eye. .

Edwards’ plate (No. 177) obviously figures a bird without yellow about
the eye, and his excellent description makes no mention of an orange orbital
ring. ‘Linnaeus’ name. eruginosus, based on Edwards’, is clearly, therefore,
applicable to the bird without this ring. This-is the species of the arid
region of Colombia and I have therefore suggested Calamar as an appro-
priate type-locality.!

I am aware that Brabourne & Chubb (Bds. S. A., I, p. 82) have already
proposed to “substitute Cayenne” as the type-locality for eruginosus but
examination of the series of specimens from British and Dutch Guiana in-
dicate that the Cayenne bird is not true eruginosus. All our fifteen speci-
mens from the two Guianas named, the lower Orinoco and Bermudez,
Venezuela, have the orange orbital ring. They further differ from the Co-
lombian. bird, which I consider true eruginosus, in having the forehead
whiter, the breast and sides of the head. paler, and the auriculars less dis-
tinctly streaked; in short, are evidently distinct. Swainson’s name chry-
sophrys,® based on a Guiana bird, is obviously applicable to this form.

We found this species to be common in the Subtropical Zone of the
western slope of the Eastern Andes. Owing to our unfortunate failure to
discover suitable collecting stations in this zone on the eastern slope of this
range, we cannot say whether it is confined to the western side. An im-
mature specimen has the primary coverts green with but a slight yellow
. margin on one feather. :

Char. subsip.— Similar to P. m. melanura but smaller, the tail, relatively, much
shorter; primary coverts not tipped with yellow; tail, above, redder; forehead
greener; bare orbital region blackish instead of whitish (in dried skins); bill less
_ stout, mandible blacker.

This race, which is known only from the type-locality, appears to be the
only form of Pyrrhura recorded from the Pacific coast region of South Amer-
ica.

XX, p. 224).

I provisionally refer three adult specimens from La Candela to this
species, of which I have seen no specimens. They seem to agree more
closely with Verreaux’s plate than with the description of this species in the
Catalogue of the British Museum. The plate figures a bird having the
breast-feathers broadly tipped with whitish — described by Verreaux as
“ squame blanchatres” —; whereas, Salvadori (Cat. Bds., XX, B. M., p. 224)
describes souancet as having each feather of the breast “with two cross-
bands, a light brown one and a second blackish at the edge.” Furthermore,
the same writer describes P. berlepschi (I. ¢., p. 224) as very much like souan-
260 Bulletin American Museum of Natural History. [Vol. XXXVI,

cei, but with the hoary edges of the feathers of the throat and breast much
broader.” . Our Candela specimens, however, have the breast-feathers.
even more widely margined than in berlepschi, of which we have one specimen
from Aplobamba, Bolivia. It is evident, therefore, that the La Candela
birds cannot be satisfactorily determined without comparison with authen--
tic specimens of souancet. They measure, wing, 137-142; tail, 122-125
mm., while Verreaux states that in souancet the wing measures 130, the tail,
120 mm.

This small form of conspicillata inhabits the upper Magdalena Valley
from at least Puerto Berrio southward, and is also found in the Tropi-
eal Zone at the eastern base of the Eastern Andes. It is thus found
throughout the restricted Bogota region, a fact which in connection with
Lafresnaye’s description of the rump, etc. of conspicillata as “ pulcherrime
indigotinis”’ makes it more than probable that his type was a ‘ Bogota’ bird.

Three males from Puerto Berrio, and two from Malena, have the rump,
etc. hyacinth-blue, more purple in tone than in specimens from the more
southern and more arid parts of the Magdalena Valley.

After examination of all the described species except melanotis and

loral region and the character of the skin about the base of the bill do not
appear to be shared by any species of these genera.

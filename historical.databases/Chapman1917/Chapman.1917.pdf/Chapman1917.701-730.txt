Common at Villavicencio and upward to Buena Vista and Montere-
dondo in the Eastern Andes. This form, recognized by von Berlepsch (Rev.
Tanag.) but not by Brabourne and Chubb may readily be distinguished from
other members of the group by its comparatively uniform coloring, the
abdomen and back being but slightly darker than the breast.

Sc. & Satv., P. Z.8., 1879, p. 501 (Medellin).

This species appears to be confined to the Cauca Valley and slopes of the
adjoining mountains up to the lower border of the Subtropical Zone, from
Popayan north to the vicinity of Medellin. All the specimens from the
Cauca Valley region proper, that is south of Rio Frio, have the rump intense
flame-scarlet in the male and orange-chrome in the female. The males
therefore resemble in color the males of R. passerint though the females. of
these two species are quite unlike. This. evidently represents the extreme
development of this type of color. It is not reached by any one of nine
males from the vicinity of Medellin though the most highly colored speci-
mens in this series are nearer to it than to the orange-rumped bird known as_
R. chrysonotus. To the westward, also, over the San Antonio Pass, flam-
migerus passes into chrysonotus under conditions which, as stated below,
induce the belief that chrysonotus is a hybrid between flammigerus and
seteronotus.

my opinion is a hybrid between these species. This belief is based chiefly
on the occurrence at the same place of specimens some of which are nearest
flammigerus and others nearest icteronotus, and these two sets of specimens
are consequently too unlike each other to be the product of the same environ-
ment. For example, the rump in males from Caldas in the arid upper
Dagua Valley, and within a short distance of the type-locality of chrysonotus,
varies from cadmium-yellow to orange-chrome, while one of the two females
has the rump light cadmium the underparts lemon-chrome, deeper but with
no red on the breast or crissum, and the other has the rump orange-chrome
the underparts deep lemon-chrome with breast and crissum strongly washed
with cadmium-orange. The rump in ten males from the vicinity of Medel-
lin, presented to us by Francisco Escobar, varies from cadmium-yellow to the
flame-scarlet of flammigerus. It is true that these intergrades between
icteronotus and flammigerus occupy ground of a different character from that
frequented by the former, which seems confined to the heavily forested
Pacific-Magdalena region, while our specimens of chrysonotus come from the
more open arid country lying between Cisneros and San Antonio and about
Medellin. This, however, is the type of country frequented by flammigerus.

replaced by R. flammigerus.

Among the thirty-three males in the specimens below recorded, only one,
taken at Dabeiba with other typical males, shows an approach toward
R. chrysonotus. In this specimen the rump is somewhat deeper yellow than
usual and scattered through it are numerous orange-tipped feathers pro-
ducing a patchy appearance.

of which are in the American Museum. Lawrence (Ann. Lyc. N. H. VIII,

is specifically designated in his description. I select therefore Am. Mus. No.

Known only from the Subtropical Zone on both slopes of the Central
Andes and the western slope of the Eastern Andes.

Our collections now contain twenty specimens of this form, only one of
which, a male from Sta. Elena, Antioquia, has any trace of a white post-
ocular mark. This specimen has four small white feathers behind the right
eye and none back of the left. Unfortunately only one of our specimens is
from the Eastern Andes, but in this, a male from Andalucia, there is no
trace of a white postocular mark. So far as our material goes, therefore, it
indicates the absence of a postocular mark in the Colombian form of this
species. If this be true Lafresnaye’s description of albitempora (Rev. Zool.
1848, p. 12) was evidently not based on a Colombian bird, as stated, and the
name albitempora is doubtless therefore applicable to one of the forms now
ranked as subspecies of it.

head of the Subtropical Zone at the head of the Magdalena River region,
however, show in their browner underparts an affinity with marginatus
though it isnot probable that intergradation occurs in this direction. Speci-
mens of marginatus from Naranjo, near Guayaquil, indicate that it occupies
the entire humid Tropical Zone of Western Ecuador. North of Cocal,
southwestern Colombia, it is unknown, nor has any form of this species
been found in the Tropical Zone of the Pacific coast of Colombia north of
the point mentioned. A specimen from La Frijolera on the western slope
of the Central Andes, above the lower Cauca River, is typical of flavigularis.
Between the ranges of marginatus and that of its Panama representative,

(Yuracaris, Bolivia).

Gymnostinops yuracares caurensis “Tonp, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., XXVI, 1913,
p. 170 (R. Caura, Venez.).

Occurs in Colombia only in Amazonia. Mr Todd has kindly loaned me
a type and topotype of his Gymnostinops yuracares caurensis and I find that
they can be closely matched by specimens in our collection from Bolivia and
western Matto Grosso. There appears to be much variation in this species
in the color of the anterior parts of the body, some birds having it analine-
yellow, others yellowish olive. In two of the Colombian specimens listed
below it is analine-yellow, in a third immature female it is much darker.
Two adult males from Napo and a ‘ Bogota’ skin are analine-yellow. Two
males and a female from Jutumpampa, Bolivia, agree with one another and
all have the parts in question analine-yellow; but in a male from the lower
Beni, Bolivia, and two males from Campo Novo, Matto Grosso, they are
dark yellowish olive.

Of the two specimens of “cawrensis” the type has the anterior areas
slightly lighter than in the Beni specimen above-mentioned, while the second
Caura specimen resembles the two specimens from Matto Grosso. In one
the bill agrees in size with that of Bolivian and Brazilian specimens, in the
other it is slightly smaller with the culmen somewhat narrower basally, but
the difference is slight and does not impress me as being of diagnostic value.
I conclude therefore that the characters attributed to caurensis (“darker . . .
bill decidedly weaker’’) are individual rather than racial.

One of the most eonspicuous and characteristic birds of the Tropical
Zone. It is found in the Cauca and- Magdalena Valleys and Amazonian
region but appears to be absent from the Pacific Coast region.

Although like other species of the genus it is an inhabitant of forests,
1917.] Chapman, Distribution of Bird-life in Colombia. 625

its altitudinal range was not found to extend beyond the upper border of the
Tropical Zone, just as the range of O. salmoni did not reach below the lower
border of the Subtropical Zone. Consequently from our base at Miraflores
(alt. 6200 ft.) in the Central Andes, near the junction of these two zones,
decumanus could be secured by working downward, salmoni by going up-
ward, and although found within an hour’s journey of one another they were
never found together. /

Our twenty-two specimens from the Cauca and Magdalena as well as
thirteen specimens from Panama (Tapalisa; El Real; Chepigana; Canal
Zone; Boqueron, Chiriqui) are uniformly glossy black and agrée with six
topotypical examples from Paramaribo, Dutch Guiana, four of which have
been kindly loaned, and two presented to us by Mr. T. E. Penard.

A male from La Morelia and a female from Florencia have a purplish
tinge to the plumage which is more or less margined with deep chestnut.
In birds from Trinidad and the Paria Peninsula, this chestnut edging is
highly developed on the back and abdominal region, but it is less pronounced
in British Guiana birds and is wholly absent on some, and shows but little
on other Dutch Guiana specimens which, as said above, closely resemble
Colombia and Panama examples.!

Ostinops atrocastaneus Scu. & Satv., P. Z. 8., 1879, p. 509 (Concordia; Envigado;

One of the most characteristic species of the Subtropical Zone of the
Western Andes and western slope of the Central Andes. While it obviously
represents O. atrocastaneus of western Ecuador, our most southern specimens
of salmoni (Gallera; La Sierra) show no perceptible approach toward our
most northern specimen of atrocastaneus (Gualea), and the characters which
separate them are so pronounced that I should not feel warranted in treating
them as subspecies without more positive evidence of intergradation than
our specimens exhibit.

Todd, from Las Vegas, Santa Marta, Col. (Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., XXX, 1917, p. 3) but as shown

Ostinops sincipitalis neglectus Cuapm., Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., XX XIII,
1914, p. 190 (Monteredondo, near Quetame, alt. 5800 ft.).

Char. subsp.— Similar to O. a. sincipitalis, but back more olivaceous and much
less brownish; the yellow frontal band narrower, and not continued backward in
superciliary stripes; the throat less yellow and more nearly the color of the breast.

This form appears to be restricted to the Subtropical Zone of the eastern
slope of the Eastern Andes. Since describing it we have received two addi-
tional specimens of true sincipitalis from Anolaima on the western slope of
the Western Andes below Facatativa, and also an adult male of Ostinops
alfredi. alfredi, a species not before represented in our collections, from
Zamora, southeastern Ecuador. The Anolaima specimens agree with others
from Fusugasugé in having the back much richer chestnut, the forehead
broadly yellow and yellow superciliaries well developed, characters in which
they differ from neglectus.

The two specimens from near the summit of the Eastern Andes (alt.
5000 ft.) below Andalucia, in southeastern Colombia referred to (J. c.) as
having the frontal band even narrower than in neglectus show in this respect
an interesting approach toward alfredi in which this mark is reduced to the
minimum in the group. The Andalucia specimens are further intermediate
in having the body more chestnut than the type of neglectus while the outer
rectrix of the male is olive and therefore like that of neglectus and sineipi-
talis; in the female, it is largely yellow on the inner web and thus like that
of alfredi!

The bill of our single specimen of alfredi (an adult male, taken Oct. 28)
is basally horn color, the apical half whitish, the mandible being browner
than the maxilla, whereas in the Andalucia specimens, and in all other
examples of our large series of this group it varies from mustard-yellow to
deep chrome. These facts obviously suggest the intergradation of alfredi
and sincipitalis through neglectus.
1917], : Chapman, Distribution of Bird-life in Colombia. 627

Even more puzzling than these two specimens from 5000 feet is an adult
male from an altitude of 2500 feet on the eastern slope above Florencia,
which has the yellow bill of neglectus and sincipitalis but in other respects
resembles angustifrons! There is no indication of yellow on the forehead or
lores, but the underparts, particularly the thighs, are more olive than in
angustifrons. Possibly this is a hybrid between angustifrons and the form df
neglectus found at Andalucia.

In Colombia this species is known only from the humid Tropical Zone of
the lower Atrato Valley eastward to the Magdalena Valley. In the Santa
Marta region and east of the Eastern Andes it is replaced by Cacicus cela
(= persicus auct.) and in western Ecuador by C. flavicrissus, but although
628 Bulletin American Museum of Natural History. [Vol. XXXVI,

these three forms are evidently representative of one another the facts at
hand indicate that they do not intergrade.

It should be particularly noted that from the Pacific coast region no
form of this species has been recorded between the River Salaqui and Esmer-
aldas. Aside from its larger size, more orange rump, etc., and smaller
amount of orange in the wing, vitellinus differs from flavicrissus in its con-
spicuously larger bill which, in color, is yellowish ivory or greenish white
rather than dark plumbeous paler terminally.

In the extent of orange or yellow in the tail both agree, and differ from
C. cela in having the outer feathers with essentially the same amount of
yellow as the inner ones; while in cela this color occupies at least the basal
two-thirds of all but the central pair of feathers.

A male from Algodonal, on the lower Magdalena River has the orange
areas slightly paler but in other respects agrees with the type of vitellinus,
while a male from Cacagualito in the Santa Marta region is equally typical
of C. cela. .

My material does not strongly support this race, which however has been
pronounced as valid by Ridgway and Hellmayr. In a series of ten fully
adult males the most purple one, having no trace of bronze wash, is from
Suapure in the lower Orinoco valley, while specimens from the Magdalena
Valley and Chocé show considerable bronze.

Colombian males are larger than those from elsewhere, but, as the
appended table shows, this does not hold good for the females. If therefore
violea is a valid form I can see no reason for not referring to it our specimens
from east of the Andes, although this region is generally included in the
range of true oryzivora.

what darker than cassini and not so dark as atronitens. In size these birds
are nearer cabanist to which, on the whole, I should refer them.

Molothrus bonariensis equatorialis Cuapm., Bull. A. M. N. H., XXXIV, 1915, p.

Char. subsp.— Size smaller than that of M. b. bonariensis, the male resembling
in color the males of other forms of this species; the female decidedly darker than the
female of M. b. cassini and still darker than the female of M. b. occidentalis, much
nearer the females of M. b. atronitens and M. b. bonariensis, but much larger than the
former, somewhat larger than the latter and with a larger, heavier bill.

Inhabits the Tropical Zone of southwestern Colombia southward into
Ecuador. Its relationships appear to be with true bonariensis rather than
with the geographically nearer cabanisi. On the coast of Peru it is replaced
by the paler M. b. occidentalis.

This surprisingly close representative of our Meadowlark is an abun-
dant bird on the Bogot& Savanna, and in arid regions it descends on both
slopes of the Eastern Andes to the Subtropical Zone. We first met with it
at an altitude of 6000 feet, on the Bogoté trail, between Villete and Faca-
tativa, and except for a brief interval at the lower border of the paramo on
the trail between Bogoté and Villavicencio, it was continuously distributed
to somewhat below Quetame, or practically to the western limit of the forests
of the eastern ridges of the range.
1917.] Chapman, Distribution of Bird-life in Colombia. 633

At Villavicencio it was not found, and if its absence from that region be
actual, it would indicate that the Meadowlarks from the upper Orinoco
(we have specimens of a small apparently undescribed form from Maipures)
were not derived from the west but from the east and north. The bird was
not met with in the Magdalena, Valley. .

The song of the Bogoté Meadowlark is of the magna type, but is often
strongly suggestive of that of neglecta. I have heard such songs from
Florida birds.

This wide-ranging Oriole is most common in the Subtropieal Zone in
which it is found on both eastern and western slopes of the three ranges of
the Andes. Of our thirty-six specimens only two come from below 3000 feet,
a male from Chicoral and a female from Villavicencio.

Specimens from the Cauca region average deeper in tone than those .
from the Eastern Andes, but the difference is slight and wholly over-lapped
by individual variation.

(451la) Icterus hondse Chapm.

Icterus honde CuarM., Bull. A. M. N. H., XX XIII, 1914, p. 191 (Honda, Col.).

Char. sp.— Wings, tail, throat and capistrum black, unmarked as in Icterus
giraudé, orange areas as deeply colored as in Icterus auratus, with which it agrees in
size.

This species is most closely related to giraudi, too closely one might
imagine for them both to breed in the same area. Itis important to note
therefore that while we have found giraudi to be widely distributed in Co-
lombia, it is there a bird of the Subtropical Zone which we have rarely found
below an altitude of 3000 ft. Consequently if honde be a representative of
giraudi their apparent distribution in the same area may be explained by
their occurrence in different zones, Aonde inhabiting the Tropical, giraudi
the Subtropical Zone.

Quiscalus macrourus Cass., Proc. Acad. N. 8. Phila., 1860, p. 1388 (Turbo;

Appears to be restricted to the sea coast where it occurs from at Teast
Santa Marta westward and southward along the Pacific coast to. Ecuador.
I can discover no difference in color between males of this form and Q. m.
major; but the bill in our six males of assimilis is obviously more decurved
at the tip than it isin major; while four adult females of assimilis are much
whiter below and browner above than any one of a large series of major.
A fifth specimen is more fulvous below and can be matched in this respect
by exceptional specimens of major but the upperparts, particularly the
crown, are less brown than in any of our specimens of major. :

Specimens from Manavi on the coast of Ecuador agree with those from
Colombia, and the comparative stability of this species indicates that the
Peruvian form does not differ from that of Ecuador and Colombia. In this
event. Sclater’s name assimilis will be replaced by Swainson’s peruvianus
(Anim. in Menag., 1838, p. 354; Lima) and the race will stand Megaquiscalus

not reaching the Cauca Valley.

the bill smaller, while those from the Atrato and lower Cauca Valleys have a
slight creamy tint on the white areas indicating an approach toward C. a.

region); Scu. & Sauv., P. Z. 8., 1879, p. 510 (Retiro; Concordia; Sta. Elena).

There are two well-marked forms of Xanthoura in the Subtropical Zone
of the Bogota region; the present, and X. y. cyanodorsalis DuBois. X. y.
galeatus is here restricted to the western slopes of the Eastern Andes, and is
found also on both slopes of the Central Andes and in the more southern
parts of the Western Andes; X. y. cyanodorsalis is found on the eastern
slopes of the Eastern Andes and ranges northeastward at least to Merida,
Venezuela. Our series of over fifty specimens indicates clearly the range of
variation and characters of each of these forms.

AX. y. galeatus, as has been pointed out by Ridgway (I. c.) differs from
true yncas (of which we have three Peruvian specimens) in size and, mainly,
in the greater development of the nasal plumes; from cyanodorsalis it differs
strikingly and constantly (in fresh plumaged adults) in having the head,
posterior to the blue frontal plumes, and nape marguerite-yellow, varying
in intensity. In some specimens it is clear, but more frequently it is tinged
with blue, especially at the junction with the back, which is green with, in
some specimens, a bluish wash. The amount of blue on the hindhead,
nape, and back is apparently largely dependent on age, young birds (with
small nasal plumes) having the maximum amount, sufficient in juvenal
plumage nearly to obscure the pale yellow of the head.

In cyanodorsalis, the area which in galeatus is marguerite-yellow, is paler
and is restricted to the occiput the whole nape being blue; while ‘the
is usually well tinged with this color. ~

The two forms are indeed strikingly different and there has not, I belj
been any question as to their distinctness, but authors do not agree

   
 
  
638 Bulletin American Museum of Natural History. [Vol.

which one DuBois’s name of cyanodorsalis should be applied. Ridgway fixes
it on the blue-naped, blue-backed bird of the eastern slopes of the Andes;
Hellmayr,! on the contrary, attaches it to the pale-naped bird which Ridg-
way has called galeatus and applies a new name “andicola’’ to the blue-
naped bird taking Merida, Venezuela, as his type-locality.

Dubois’s description,’ however, as well as his figure,? seems to leave no
doubt as to which bird he applied the name eyanodorsalis. One has only
to read his diagnosis (i. ¢.) “ Similis preecedenti [= yncas yneas]; sed cervice
ceruleo-violaceo et dorso ceruleo” to be convinced that of the two he could
here have had only the blue-naped bird in mind, and if further confirmation
of this belief be required, it is to be found in his plate which is | obviously
based on the blue-napeéd- bird.

Ridgway’s type was without exact locality but was believed to havé
come from western Colombia and was part of a collection which contained
specimens of Cyanolyca quindiuna Scl. I would suggest therefore as a
definite type-locality El Eden, a posada at an altitude of 8300 feet, on the
Quindio Trail, about ten miles west of Ibagiie, from which we have typical
specimens.

We found this Jay only on the eastern slope of the Eastern Andes where
it was locally common in the Subtropical Zone. When allowance is made
-for differences due to age, I find no indication of intergradation between
this form arid galeatus in our series of thirteen of the former and. forty-nine
of the latter, and this in spite of the fact that we took specimens of both at
localities: within thirty-five miles of each other (Quetame on the eastern
slope, Fusugasugé on the western slope of the Eastern Andes).
